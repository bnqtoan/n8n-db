# Sub nodes[#](#sub-nodes "Permanent link")

Sub nodes attach to root nodes within a group of cluster nodes. They configure the overall functionality of the cluster.

[Cluster nodes](../../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

*   **completion**: Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
*   **hallucinations**: Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
*   **vector database**: A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
