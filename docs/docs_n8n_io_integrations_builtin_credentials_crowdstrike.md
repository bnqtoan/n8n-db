This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/crowdstrike/) on n8n's website.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

*   The **URL** of your CrowdStrike instance
*   A **Client ID**: Generated by creating a new API Client in Crowdstrike in **Support > API Clients and Keys**.
*   A **Client Secret**: Generated by creating a new API Client in Crowdstrike in **Support > API Clients and Keys**.

A broad outline of the appropriate steps is available publicly at the CrowdStrike blog: [Getting Access to the CrowdStrike API](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/get-access-falcon-apis/).
