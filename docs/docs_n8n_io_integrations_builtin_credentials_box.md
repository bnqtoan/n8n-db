Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch or need more detail on what's happening in the OAuth web flow, you'll need to create a Custom App. Refer to the [Box OAuth2 Setup documentation](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/oauth2/oauth2-setup/) for more information.
