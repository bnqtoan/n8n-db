# Test a node[#](#test-a-node "Permanent link")

This section contains information about testing your node.

There are two ways to test your node:

*   Manually, by [running it on your own machine](run-node-locally/) within a local n8n instance.
*   Automatically, using the [linter](node-linter/).

You should use both methods before publishing your node.
