# Cloud admin dashboard[#](#cloud-admin-dashboard "Permanent link")

Instance owners can access the admin dashboard to manage their Cloud instance. This is where you can upgrade your n8n version and set the timezone.

## Access the dashboard from the app[#](#access-the-dashboard-from-the-app "Permanent link")

1.  [Log in to n8n](https://app.n8n.cloud/magic-link)
2.  Select **Admin Dashboard**. n8n opens the dashboard.

## Access the dashboard if the app is offline[#](#access-the-dashboard-if-the-app-is-offline "Permanent link")

If your instance is down, you can still access the admin dashboard. When you log in to the app, n8n will ask you if you want a magic link to access your dashboard. Select **Send magic link**, then check your email for the link.
