# Deploy a node[#](#deploy-a-node "Permanent link")

This section contains details on how to deploy and share your node.

You can choose to:

*   [Submit your node to the community node repository](submit-community-nodes/). This makes it available for everyone to use, and allows you to [install and use it](../../community-nodes/installation/) like any other community node. This is the only way to use custom nodes on cloud.
*   Install the node into your n8n instance as a [private node](install-private-nodes/).
