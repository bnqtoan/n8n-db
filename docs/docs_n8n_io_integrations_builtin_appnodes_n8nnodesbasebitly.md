## What to do if your operation isn't supported[#](#what-to-do-if-your-operation-isnt-supported "Permanent link")

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1.  In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2.  Select the service you want to connect to.
3.  Select your credential.
