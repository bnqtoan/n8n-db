# Troubleshooting SAML SSO[#](#troubleshooting-saml-sso "Permanent link")

If you get an error when testing your SAML setup, check the following:

*   Does the app you created in your IdP support SAML?
*   Did you enter the n8n redirect URL and entity ID in the correct fields in your IdP?
*   Is the metadata XML correct? Check that the metadata you copied into n8n is formatted correctly.
