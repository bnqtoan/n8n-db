# My Workflow

## Use cases:

*   **Workflow Auto-Layout:** This workflow demonstrates how to automatically position nodes in an n8n workflow for better readability and organization. This is helpful when dealing with complex workflows that are difficult to manually arrange.
*   **Dynamic Workflow Updates:** It showcases a method to update an n8n workflow's layout by calling an external API ("Magic Positioning IA2S") and then updating the current workflow with the new layout data.
*   **AI agent experimentation:** This workflow can be used for AI agent building and testing by using some dummy node to help building.

## How it works:

The workflow is triggered manually or by a schedule. The core logic involves:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow starts with a manual trigger or a schedule trigger.
2.  **Get Workflow:** Uses the "Get n8n Workflow" node to retrieve the current workflow's JSON definition.
3.  **Magic Positioning IA2S:** An HTTP request is sent to an external API (`https://api.ia2s.app/webhook/workflow/magic/position`) with the workflow JSON as input. This API presumably calculates an optimized layout for the workflow.
4.  **Update Workflow:** The response from the "Magic Positioning IA2S" API, which contains the layout information, is used to update the existing n8n workflow using the "Update n8n Workflow" node. This node modifies the node positions within the workflow.
5.  **Webhook response:** Respond a message when the workflow has been updated
6.  **AI agent flow:** There is an incomplete flow for an AI agent building and testing using `langchain` nodes that uses OpenAI.

## Services:

*   **n8n API:** Used to retrieve and update workflows.
*   **IA2S API:** An external API (presumably) responsible for calculating the optimal layout of the workflow.
*   **OpenAI API:** Used for AI agent flow.
