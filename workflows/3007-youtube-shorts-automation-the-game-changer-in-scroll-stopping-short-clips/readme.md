# YouTube Shorts Automation Agent - The Game-Changer in YouTube Shorts Automation

## Use cases:

*   **Automated Content Curation for YouTube Shorts:** Automatically extract, filter, and schedule the upload of YouTube Shorts based on specific criteria, saving time and effort in manual content selection and posting.
*   **Consistent Content Delivery:** Maintain a steady stream of YouTube Shorts uploads, ensuring consistent engagement with your audience and improved channel visibility.
*   **Content Repurposing:** Extract snippets or highlights from longer videos or other sources to create engaging YouTube Shorts, expanding the reach of existing content.

## How it works:

1.  **Fill information to Start:** A Form Trigger initiates the workflow based on user input.
2.  **Prepare Shorts1:** An HTTP Request node (presumably fetching some initial data or configurations).
3.  **Wait #1:** A Wait node pauses the workflow for a specified duration, likely to respect rate limits or scheduling constraints.
4.  **Extract Shorts:** Another HTTP Request node extracts YouTube Shorts content from a specified source.
5.  **Structure Shorts:** The Split Out node likely transforms or formats the extracted Shorts data.
6.  **Filter the Best Shorts to Upload:** A Code node filters the extracted Shorts based on defined criteria.
7.  **Send shorts 1 at a time:** The Split In Batches node processes the filtered shorts one at a time.
8.  **Download the Short in the Right Format:** An HTTP Request node downloads the selected Short in the appropriate format.
9.  **Upload to your YouTube Account:** A YouTube node uploads the downloaded Short to the specified YouTube channel.
10. **Wait #2:** A Wait node pauses the workflow again. This is for delaying the re-processing of the main batch or further processing.
