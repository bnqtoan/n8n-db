# SSE Stream Example

## Use cases:
*   Monitor a website for real-time updates and trigger actions based on the changes.
*   Receive live data streams from an API and process the information for analysis or display.
*   Create real-time notifications based on events happening on a specific platform.

## How it works:
This workflow uses the "SSE Trigger" node to connect to a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream at the specified URL (`https://n8n.io`).  The workflow is initiated whenever the SSE stream pushes new data.  Currently, it only has the trigger and no actions connected to it; further nodes can be added to process the incoming data.

## Services:
*   n8n.io (SSE Stream)
