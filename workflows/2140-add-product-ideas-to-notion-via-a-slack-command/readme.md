# Idea to Notion via Slack Command

## Use cases:

*   **Idea Collection:** Capture ideas quickly from a Slack channel using a custom slash command and automatically save them to a Notion database for later review and development.
*   **Feature Request Management:** Allow team members to submit feature requests via Slack, which are then organized and tracked in a Notion database.
*   **Simple Task Creation:** A user can use a Slack command to initiate the creation of a new task or entry in a Notion database, streamlining the task management process.

## How it works:

1.  **Slack Slash Command Trigger:** The workflow is initiated when a user types the `/idea` command in a Slack channel. The **Webhook** node receives the data sent by Slack.
2.  **Setup Notion details:** The **Set me up** node sets the Notion URL, this can be configured.
3.  **Command Routing:** The **Switch** node checks if the command is `/idea`.
4.  **Notion Database Entry Creation:** The **Notion** node creates a new page in a specified Notion database. The title of the page is set to the text provided after the `/idea` command in Slack, and the "Creator" property is populated with the Slack username of the user who submitted the idea.
5.  **Slack Confirmation:** The **Hidden message to add feature details** node sends a confirmation message back to the user in Slack. This message includes a link to the newly created Notion page, encouraging the user to add more details and a hypothesis to the idea.
