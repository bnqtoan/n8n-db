# AI Agent: Google Calendar Assistant using OpenAI

## Use cases:

- **Scheduling Assistant:** Users can interact with the AI agent via a chat interface to schedule meetings, set reminders, and manage their Google Calendar without manually navigating the calendar interface.
- **Event Information Retrieval:** Users can ask the AI agent to retrieve information about upcoming events, such as dates, times, and descriptions, using natural language queries.
- **Hands-Free Calendar Management:** Integrate with voice assistants or other chat platforms to enable voice-activated or text-based calendar management, ideal for on-the-go scheduling.

## How it works:

1.  **Chat Trigger:** The workflow starts when a message is received via the "When chat message received" node, acting as the entry point.
2.  **AI Agent Processing:** The "Calendar AI Agent" node processes the user's message using a predefined system prompt. This prompt instructs the AI agent to act as a Google Calendar assistant, capable of creating events and retrieving event data.
3.  **LLM Interaction:** The "OpenAI Chat Model" node (GPT-4o by default) handles natural language understanding and generates appropriate responses or actions.
4.  **Memory Management:** The "Window Buffer Memory" node manages the conversation history to maintain context, allowing for follow-up questions and related actions.
5.  **Tool Selection & Execution:** Based on the user's request, the AI agent selects either the "Google Calendar - Get Events" or "Google Calendar - Create events" node to interact with the Google Calendar API. It dynamically populates the necessary fields (e.g., start\_date, end\_date, event\_title, event\_description) based on the chat input. The AI agent will confirm details with the user before finalizing actions.
6.  **Calendar Interaction:** The selected Google Calendar node performs the requested action (either retrieving or creating events) on the user's calendar.
