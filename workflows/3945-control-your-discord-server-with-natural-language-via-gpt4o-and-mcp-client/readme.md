# Discord MCP Chat Agent

## Use cases:

- **Automated Discord Server Management:**  Allows users to manage their Discord server (roles, channels, etc.) using natural language commands via chat.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot for Discord:**  Creates a chatbot that responds to user queries and executes actions on the Discord server based on the intent of the message.
- **Natural Language Interface for Server Tasks:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for performing complex server tasks without needing to use Discord's UI or commands directly.

## How it works:

1.  **Chat Message Trigger:** The workflow starts when a new chat message is received in Discord via the "When chat message received" node.
2.  **AI Agent Processing:** The "AI Agent" node receives the chat message as input. This node acts as the central processing unit, orchestrating the workflow based on the message content.
3.  **Language Model Interpretation:** The "OpenAI Chat Model" node (using the gpt-4o model) interprets the chat message and determines the user's intent. It leverages the OpenAI API for natural language understanding.
4.  **MCP Client Interaction:** Based on the interpreted intent, the "AI Agent" utilizes the "Discord MCP Client" node to execute actions on the Discord server. The MCP (Manageable Chat Platform) client communicates with an MCP server (specified by the `sseEndpoint`) to perform tasks like creating channels, assigning roles, etc.
5.  **Action Execution:** The Discord MCP Client sends requests to a MCP server to execute server management functions. The MCP server will have to be set up separately.

## Services:

-   **Discord:**  The chat platform where the workflow receives messages.
-   **OpenAI API:**  Used for natural language understanding and intent recognition.
-   **MCP (Manageable Chat Platform) Server:** A separate server responsible for managing the Discord server based on commands from the n8n workflow.
