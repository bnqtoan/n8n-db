# Stripe Invoice Automation Workflow

## Use Cases:

-   **Automated Invoice Generation:** Automatically create and finalize invoices in Stripe when a new customer is added or a trigger event occurs.
-   **Streamlined Billing Process:** Simplify the billing process by automating the creation of invoice items, invoices, and finalization steps.
-   **Subscription Management:** Integrate with other systems to automatically generate invoices for recurring subscriptions in Stripe.

## How it Works:

This workflow automates the process of creating and finalizing invoices in Stripe.

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow starts with a "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" node, which acts as a manual trigger for testing purposes. In a production environment, this could be replaced by a different trigger, such as a webhook or schedule.
2.  **Create Customer:** A "Create Customer" node of type "Stripe" creates a new customer in Stripe. This step likely requires appropriate credentials and customer data.
3.  **Stripe | Invoice Items:** An "Stripe | Invoice Items" node of type "httpRequest" adds invoice items to the Stripe account, this likely requires parameters to identify the products/services and their respective prices.
4.  **Stripe | Create invoice:** An "Stripe | Create invoice" node of type "httpRequest" creates an invoice in Stripe, this likely requires parameters to identify the customer, invoice items and total amount.
5.  **Stripe | Finalize invoice:** Finally, an "Stripe | Finalize invoice" node of type "httpRequest" finalizes the invoice in Stripe, preparing it for payment.
