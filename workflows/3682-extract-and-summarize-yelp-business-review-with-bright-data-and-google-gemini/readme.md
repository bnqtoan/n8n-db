# Extract & Summarize Yelp Business Review with Bright Data and Google Gemini

## Use cases:

*   **Market Research:** Automatically gather and summarize customer reviews for restaurants in a specific location to understand market trends and customer preferences.
*   **Competitive Analysis:** Monitor competitor's Yelp reviews, extracting key insights and overall sentiment to identify strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Reputation Management:** Track and summarize reviews for a business, allowing for quick identification of areas needing improvement and proactive engagement with customers.

## How it works:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow is initiated manually using the "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" node.
2.  **Set Yelp URL:** The "Set Yelp URL with the Bright Data Zone" node sets the target Yelp URL and Bright Data zone for data extraction. This includes the Yelp search query and the Bright Data web unlocker zone.
3.  **Fetch Reviews (HTTP Request):** The "HTTP Request to fetch the Yelp Business Reviews" node uses Bright Data's API to scrape Yelp business review data from the specified URL, handling anti-bot measures.
4.  **Extract Structured Data:**  The "Structured Data Extractor" node uses a Google Gemini Chat Model to analyze the raw HTML data and extract key information like restaurant name, location, average rating, review count, and individual reviews with details like reviewer, rating, date, and text. The "Structured Output Parser" node ensures the extraction follows a pre-defined JSON schema for consistency.
5.  **Summarize the extracted Reviews:** The "Summarization Chain" node uses a Google Gemini Chat Model to generate a concise summary of the extracted structured review data.
6.  **Merge:** The "Merge" node combines the structured data and the summary generated by the "Summarization Chain" node.
7.  **Webhook Notification:** Finally, the "Webhook Notifier for the merged response" node sends the extracted reviews and the generated summary to a specified webhook URL (e.g., a Slack channel or another application).

## Services:

*   **Yelp:** Source of business review data.
*   **Bright Data:** Proxy service for web scraping.
*   **Google Gemini (PaLM) API:** Language model for data extraction and summarization.
*   **Webhook.site (Example):**  External service for receiving the final data payload. Could be replaced with any webhook endpoint like Slack, Discord, etc.
