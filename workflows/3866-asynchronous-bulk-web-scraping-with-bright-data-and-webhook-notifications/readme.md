# Structured Bulk Data Extract with Bright Data Web Scraper

## Use cases:

- **E-commerce Product Monitoring:** Automatically extract product details (price, availability, reviews) from e-commerce websites like Amazon on a large scale, enabling price tracking and competitive analysis.
- **Real Estate Data Aggregation:** Collect property listings, prices, and features from various real estate websites to create a comprehensive database for market analysis.
- **News Article Extraction:** Scrape news articles from multiple online sources to gather data for sentiment analysis or topic modeling.

## How it works:

This workflow automates the process of extracting structured data from websites using Bright Data's Web Scraper. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Initialization:** The workflow starts with a manual trigger. Then sets the dataset ID and the URL requests for scraping from the Bright Data services.
2.  **Trigger Web Scraper:** It sends a request to the Bright Data API to initiate the web scraping process, specifying the dataset ID, format, and webhook settings.
3.  **Snapshot ID:** Retrieves the snapshot ID, which is the identifier for the scraped dataset.
4.  **Check Snapshot Status:** It uses the snapshot ID to checks the status of the scraping job by sending an HTTP request to Bright Data's progress endpoint
5.  **Conditional Branching:** The "If" node checks if the scraping job is "ready". If not, it waits for a specified amount of time (30 seconds).
6.  **Error Check:** If the scraping status is "ready" the workflows checks for errors.
7.  **Download Snapshot:** Downloads the scraped data in JSON format from Bright Data.
8.  **Data Aggregation:** Aggregates the data into a single JSON.
9.  **Webhook Notification:** Sends the extracted data to a specified webhook URL (e.g., Webhook.site) for external processing or storage.
10. **Binary Data Conversion and File Writing:** Transforms the JSON data into binary format and writes it to a JSON file on disk.
