# My Workflow

## Use cases:

- **Automated Refund Processing**: This workflow can be used to automatically process refunds when a specific event is triggered (e.g., a user requests a refund through a Telegram bot).
- **Payment Workflow Management:** It can manage and update payment-related information, potentially interacting with payment gateways and internal systems.
- **Telegram Bot Integration for E-commerce**: Useful for an e-commerce business using a Telegram bot to handle actions like sending invoices, approving pre-checkout updates, and processing refunds, streamlining customer interactions.

## How it works:

1.  **Trigger**: The workflow starts either via an "Execute Workflow Trigger" (likely triggered by another workflow) or manually via the "Make a Refund" node. The "Execute Workflow Trigger" passes data to the "Trigger Data" node.
2.  **Data Preparation**: Several "Set" nodes prepare data for subsequent steps, including "Chat ID," "Bot API token," "Invoice Data," and "Refund Data." These nodes likely format the data or retrieve necessary API keys.
3.  **Action Routing**: The "Actions" switch node likely routes the workflow based on the type of action to perform (e.g., invoice, pre-checkout update, refund).
4.  **Invoice Handling**: If the action is invoice-related, the workflow sends invoice data to an "HTTP Request" node ("Send Invoice").
5.  **Pre-Checkout Updates**: If the action is pre-checkout-related, the workflow sends updates via the "Approove / Pre-Checkout Update" "HTTP Request" node.
6.  **Refund Processing**: If the action is refund-related, the workflow processes refunds via "Refund" "HTTP Request" node.
7. **Google Sheet Integration** The workflow writes telegram payment charge ID to Google Sheet.
8. **Workflow execution**: Start another workflow via "Start Payment Workflow" node.
9.  **Notifications**: A "Telegram" node ("Success Message") sends a success message upon completion of a task.

## Services:

-   Telegram (via Telegram Bot API)
-   Google Sheets
-   Potentially other services via HTTP Request nodes (the specific services are not identifiable without more details on the HTTP Request node configurations)
