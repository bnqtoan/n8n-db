# Shopify Order Trigger

## Use cases:

*   **Real-time Order Notifications:** Immediately receive notifications in a chat application (e.g., Slack, Discord) whenever a new order is placed on your Shopify store.
*   **Automated Order Data Backup:** Automatically back up new order details to a spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets, Airtable) or database for record-keeping and analysis.
*   **Triggering Fulfillment Processes:** Initiate fulfillment workflows in other systems upon receiving a new order, ensuring timely processing and shipping.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered automatically whenever a new order is created in your Shopify store.

1.  **Shopify Trigger:** The workflow starts with the "Shopify Trigger" node. This node is configured to listen for the `orders/create` event from your Shopify store. When a new order is placed, Shopify sends a webhook notification to n8n, triggering the workflow.
