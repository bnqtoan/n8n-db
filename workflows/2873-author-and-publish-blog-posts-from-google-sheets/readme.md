# Blog Automation TEMPLATE

## Use cases:

- **Automated Content Generation:** Automatically generate blog post drafts based on topics and outlines defined in a Google Sheet.
- **Scheduled Publishing:** Schedule blog posts to be published at specific times, ensuring a consistent flow of content.
- **Content Repurposing:** Automatically update existing blog posts with new information or insights generated by an AI model.

## How it works:

1.  **Triggers:** The workflow starts either on a schedule (using the `ScheduleTrigger` node) or manually (using the `ManualTrigger` node).
2.  **Settings:** The `Settings` node stores configuration parameters like Google Sheet URLs, WordPress credentials, and sheet names.
3.  **Data Fetching:**
    -   The workflow fetches data from two Google Sheets: `Schedule` and `Config`.
    -   `Schedule` contains the blog post schedule, topics, and current status.
    -   `Config` contains configuration like prompts for LLMs and other settings.
4.  **Data Preparation:**
    -   The `PreparedData` node takes the data from the `Schedule` sheet and the configuration from the `Config` sheet and prepares the data for the LLM (Language Model).
    -   It replaces placeholders in prompts with values from the Google Sheet rows, creating tailored prompts for the AI.
5.  **LLM Interaction:**
    -   The `AgentLLM` node receives the prompt and uses a configured OpenAI model (via OpenRouter) to generate content for the blog post.
    -   The `Basic LLM Chain` node is being used to author a blog post.
6.  **Data Recombination:**
    -   The `RecombinedDataRow` node merges the generated content with the existing data from the Google Sheet, using the previously set action as the key.
    -   It extracts the post id or the error message to give feedback about success or failure.
    -   It normalizes and re-merges the output data structure.
7.  **Action Execution:**
    -   `IfTakeAction` checks if an action should be taken on a row based on a pre-defined action.
    -   `IfActionPublish` checks if the Action column is set to publish.
    -   `IfScheduledNow` checks if the scheduled time has been passed and it is time to publish.
    -   `IfPromptExists` checks if the prompt exists to avoid sending empty prompt to the LLM.
8.  **WordPress Publishing:**
    -   The `PrepareXmlPost` node prepares the data into an XML format that can be understood by WordPress.
    -   The `CreatePost` node publishes the generated content to WordPress using the XML-RPC protocol.
    -   Generic XMLHttpRequest with subsequent response handling is being used.
9.  **Google Sheets Update:**
    -   The `SaveBackToSheet` node updates the `Schedule` Google Sheet with the new content and status (e.g., "Draft", "Published").
    -   The `SetToPublish` node sets the blog post status to "Published" in the Google Sheet.
10. **Logging:**
    -   The workflow logs all actions and errors to a `Log` Google Sheet, providing a history of the automation process.
