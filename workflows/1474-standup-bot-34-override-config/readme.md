# Standup Bot - Override Config

## Use cases:

- **Update Standup Bot Configuration:** Allows authorized users to modify the configuration settings of a standup bot without directly accessing the server's file system. This is useful for adjusting schedules, notification preferences, or other bot behaviors.
- **Centralized Configuration Management:** Enables a central point of control for managing the standup bot's configuration, ensuring consistency and simplifying updates across different environments.

## How it works:

1.  The workflow is triggered manually using the "On clicking 'execute'" node.
2.  The "Move Binary Data" node converts JSON data (presumably passed in via the trigger, though the specific data isn't defined in this JSON) into a binary format, encoding it as UTF-8 and assigning the filename `standup-bot-config.json`.
3.  The "Write Binary File" node then writes the binary data to a file named `/home/node/.n8n/standup-bot-config.json`. This effectively overrides the existing configuration file for the standup bot.

## Services:

- None (This workflow interacts directly with the file system)

## Hashtags:
