# Advanced Sales Ai agent

## Use cases:

- **Automated Lead Qualification:** Automatically engage with potential leads on WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, qualify them based on their responses, and store their information in Airtable.
- **AI-Powered Sales Assistance:** Provide real-time, AI-driven support to sales representatives by offering relevant sales techniques and product knowledge based on customer interactions.
- **24/7 Customer Engagement:** Maintain continuous engagement with customers across multiple platforms, even outside of business hours, using AI to answer questions and provide information.

## How it works:

This workflow acts as an advanced AI-powered sales agent, automating interactions across multiple platforms and leveraging AI for intelligent responses.

1.  **Trigger Events:** The workflow starts with triggers for WhatsApp messages, Facebook posts, Instagram posts, chat messages, and Airtable form submissions.
2.  **Data Handling:** Incoming data is pre-processed and formatted using "Edit Fields" nodes.
3.  **Platform-Specific Logic:** Dedicated "If" nodes determine the source platform (Facebook or Instagram) and trigger appropriate actions and message formatting.
4.  **AI Agent Core:**
    *   The core of the workflow is an AI Agent that uses OpenAI models for natural language understanding and response generation.
    *   It leverages vector stores (Supabase) for knowledge retrieval and chat memory (Postgres) to maintain context.
    *   Multiple specialized "toolWorkflow" agents are defined for CRM and calendar management.
5.  **Intelligent Routing:** The "Switch" node intelligently routes the AI-generated responses to the appropriate platform (WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram) based on the initial trigger.
6.  **Platform Responses:** Based on the initial trigger the message is replied on the correct channel.
7.  **Lead Management:** When a new Airtable form is submitted, the information will be passed to the sales agent, and it can create a new contact, and update the lead.
