# OpenSea Analytics Agent Tool

## Use cases
1. **NFT Market Analysis**: Traders can use this workflow to track real-time sales volumes, floor price changes, and emerging trends across popular NFT collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club or Azuki.  
2. **Wallet Activity Monitoring**: Investigate all NFT transactions (sales/transfers/listings) for specific Ethereum wallet addresses to detect unusual activity or track collector behavior.  
3. **Historical NFT Research**: Analyze an NFT's full transaction history by its contract address and token ID to verify provenance or assess market performance.  

## How it works
The workflow combines AI with OpenSea's API to process natural language queries into actionable NFT data insights:

1. A user provides a query (e.g., "Show BAYC floor price history") via the Workflow Input Trigger node  
2. The **Analytics Agent Brain** (GPT-4) interprets the request using a predefined system message containing OpenSea API specifications  
3. The AI agent selects the appropriate OpenSea API tool based on context:  
   - Collection stats (`/stats` endpoint)  
   - Event tracking (`/events` endpoints)  
   - Wallet/collection/NFT-specific history  
4. API responses are processed by the AI to deliver structured insights while adhering to OpenSea's blockchain naming conventions  

Key nodes: Workflow Input Trigger → AI Agent → Memory Buffer → Targeted OpenSea API Request → AI Analysis.
