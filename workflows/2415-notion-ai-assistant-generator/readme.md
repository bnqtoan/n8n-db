# Notion AI Assistant Generator

## Use cases:

- **Rapidly create AI-powered chatbots for different Notion databases:** Quickly adapt a pre-built AI assistant workflow to work with various Notion databases, saving significant development time.
- **Automate knowledge base access:** Enable users to ask questions and receive answers directly from a Notion database via a chat interface, streamlining information retrieval.
- **Customizable AI assistant generation:** Tailor the AI assistant's behavior by modifying the workflow template and providing specific instructions during the generation process.

## How it works:

1.  **Chat Trigger:** The workflow starts when a user provides a Notion database URL through a chat interface (e.g., n8n Chat Trigger).
2.  **Notion Database Schema Retrieval:** The workflow extracts the database schema (properties, types, etc.) from the provided Notion database URL using the Notion API.
3.  **Schema Standardization:** The database schema is simplified and standardized into a format suitable for the AI model.
4.  **Workflow Generation with AI Agent:** The core logic involves an AI Agent (using Anthropic Chat Model or similar) that takes a template n8n workflow and the standardized Notion database schema as input. It modifies the template to create a new workflow tailored to the specific Notion database. This includes:
    *   Updating the "Search notion database" node to match the new database ID and properties.
    *   Adjusting the prompt in the "AI Agent" node within the generated workflow to reflect the new database's structure and content.
5.  **Workflow Validation:** The generated workflow JSON is validated to ensure it is a valid n8n workflow configuration.  If the JSON is invalid, the process loops back to the AI Agent with a feedback prompt to attempt to correct the issue.
6.  **Success/Error Reporting:** If the workflow is valid, it is returned to the user in the chat interface as a JSON code block they can copy and paste into their n8n instance. If the URL is invalid or the generated workflow has issues, an error message is returned to the user.

## Services:

-   **Notion API:** Interacts with the Notion API to retrieve database schema and query data.
-   **Anthropic or OpenAI API:** Utilizes Anthropic Chat Model to generate and validate the new workflow JSON.
