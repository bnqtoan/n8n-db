# WhatsApp Assistant AI Agent Small Business

## Use cases:

- **Automated Customer Support:**  Provide instant answers to customer queries on WhatsApp, such as product information, order status, or troubleshooting steps, freeing up human agents for more complex issues.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Allow customers to book appointments or reservations through WhatsApp by interacting with the AI agent, eliminating the need for phone calls or manual scheduling.
- **Lead Qualification:**  Engage with potential customers on WhatsApp to gather information and qualify them as leads for the sales team, improving lead generation efficiency.

## How it works:

This workflow creates an AI-powered assistant that interacts with users via WhatsApp. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Input Submissions (WhatsApp Trigger):** The workflow starts when a message is received on a designated WhatsApp number.
2.  **Signpost (If):** Acts as a gate to control the flow of the execution.
3.  **AI Agent:** This is the core of the workflow. It processes the incoming message using a Large Language Model.
4.  **Groq Chat Model:** This node represents the Large Language Model (LLM) that the AI Agent uses to understand and generate responses. It is configured to use Groq's chat model for faster inference.
5.  **Simple Memory:** This node provides memory capabilities to the AI agent. It stores past interactions so that the agent can maintain context and provide more relevant responses over time.
6.  **Output (WhatsApp):** The AI Agent's response is then sent back to the user via WhatsApp.

## Services:

-   **WhatsApp:** Used as the primary communication channel for interacting with users.
-   **Groq:** Utilized as the LLM service to power the AI agent's language understanding and generation capabilities.
