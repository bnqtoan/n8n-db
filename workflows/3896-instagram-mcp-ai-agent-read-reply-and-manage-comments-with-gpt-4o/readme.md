# MCP Server Instagram

## Use cases:

- **Automated Instagram Engagement:** Automatically respond to comments, reply to direct messages, and search for relevant media based on user input, enhancing engagement with followers.
- **Social Media Customer Support:** Provide instant answers to customer queries on Instagram by leveraging AI to understand questions and fetch appropriate information.
- **Content Discovery and Curation:** Use AI to search for media, analyze details, and curate content based on specific criteria, assisting in content planning and strategy.

## How it works:

1.  The workflow starts when a chat message is received ("**When chat message received**" node).
2.  The input message is mapped to a format suitable for the AI Agent ("**Instagram Mapping**" node).
3.  The mapped message is sent to the "**AI Agent**" node, which uses a language model ("**Chat Model**") and memory ("**Simple Memory**") to process the message and determine the appropriate action.
4.  The "**AI Agent**" utilizes the "**üóÇÔ∏è MCP Instagram**" tool, which provides access to various Instagram functionalities.
5.  Based on the AI Agent's decision, one of the following actions may be triggered:
    *   Search for media ("**Search Media**").
    *   Retrieve media details ("**Media Details**").
    *   Search for comments ("**Search Comment**").
    *   Reply to comments ("**Reply Comment**").
    *   Send a direct message ("**Send Direct Message**").
6. The data is returned to the AI agent, which decides on a output.
