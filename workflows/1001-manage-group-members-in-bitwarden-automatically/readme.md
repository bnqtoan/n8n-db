# Bitwarden Group and Member Management Workflow

## Use cases:

*   **Automated Group Creation and Member Assignment:** Automatically creates a new group in Bitwarden and adds existing members to it. This streamlines the process of setting up access control for new projects or teams.
*   **Dynamic Group Membership Updates:** When new members are added to Bitwarden, this workflow can automatically add them to relevant groups based on predefined criteria.
*   **Scheduled Group Membership Audit:** Regularly verify group memberships in Bitwarden to ensure that users have the appropriate level of access.

## How it works:

1.  **Create a New Bitwarden Group:** The workflow starts by creating a new group in Bitwarden using the "Bitwarden" node. This node is configured to create a 'group' resource.
2.  **Retrieve All Bitwarden Members:** The "Bitwarden1" node fetches a list of all members in your Bitwarden organization.
3.  **Add Members to the New Group:** The "Bitwarden2" node updates the group created in step 1, adding all the members retrieved in step 2. It uses the group ID from the first node and member IDs from the second node.
4.  **Retrieve Members of the Updated Group (Verification):** The "Bitwarden3" node retrieves all members of the group that was updated in step 3, allowing you to verify that the members were added successfully.
