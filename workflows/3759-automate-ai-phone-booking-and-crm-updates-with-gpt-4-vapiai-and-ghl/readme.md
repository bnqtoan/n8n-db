# Advanced Appointment Booking Ai Agent

## Use cases:

*   **Automated Appointment Scheduling:** Allow clients to book appointments through a conversational AI agent, freeing up staff time.
*   **Lead Qualification and Booking:** Qualify leads based on their needs and automatically book appointments for promising candidates.
*   **24/7 Availability:** Provide appointment booking services outside of business hours, improving customer experience.

## How it works:

1.  **GHL Webhook:** The workflow starts when a new lead interacts with the system, triggering a webhook from GoHighLevel (GHL).
2.  **Notifications:** The workflow sends initial email notifications to both the owner and the client, confirming receipt of the inquiry.
3.  **AI Agent Core:** The AI Agent takes over the conversation, powered by a language model and conversational memory for context.
4.  **Validation AI** before passing the control to the AI agent core the validation AI makes sure the language Model is properly set.
5.  **VAPI Call:** The agent interacts with an external service (likely using an API) to check available appointment slots.
6.  **Post-call Analysis:** After the call, the AI analyzes the conversation to determine if a booking was made.
7.  **Booking Made Check:** A conditional node checks the analysis result. If an appointment was booked:
    *   **GHL Update:** The workflow updates the lead's information in GoHighLevel.
    *   **Notify Owner - Confirmed:** The owner receives a notification about the confirmed booking.
8. If no booking was made:

    *   **Notify Owner - No booking:** The owner receives a notification about the lack of booking.
