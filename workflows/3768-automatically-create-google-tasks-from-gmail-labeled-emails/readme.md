# ðŸ“¦ New Email âž” Create Google Task

## Use cases:

- Automatically create a Google Task from important emails to ensure timely follow-up on requests or action items.
- Manage personal to-do lists by converting emails that require action into tasks within Google Tasks.
- Streamline project management by automatically generating tasks from client emails or internal communications directly into a project's task list.

## How it works:

1.  The workflow starts with the "Gmail Trigger" node, which listens for new emails in your Gmail inbox.
2.  When a new email arrives, the "Gmail Trigger" node sends the email data to the "Google Tasks" node.
3.  The "Google Tasks" node then uses this data to create a new task in Google Tasks, allowing you to manage your to-do items directly from your email.
