# Claude 3.7 Sonnet AI Agent with web search and Think functions

## Use cases:
- **Website Chatbot:**  Integrate the workflow into a website to provide users with instant answers to their queries, leveraging both the website's information and real-time web search for up-to-date details.
- **Customer Support Assistant:** Use the agent to assist customer support teams by quickly finding answers to customer questions, utilizing web search for information not readily available in internal documentation.
- **Information Retrieval and Summarization:** Allow users to ask complex questions requiring external information, with the AI agent using web search to gather relevant data and provide concise summaries.

## How it works:
1.  **Chat Trigger:** The workflow starts when a chat message is received via the "When chat message received" trigger.
2.  **AI Agent:** The "AI Agent" node acts as the core logic. It receives the user's message and its system message defines the agent's behavior: it uses web search and think functions to provide more comprehensive responses. It uses memory to retain context from prior interactions.
3.  **Anthropic Chat Model:** The "Anthropic Chat Model" node (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) processes the prompt generated by the AI Agent.
4.  **Simple Memory:** The "Simple Memory" node stores the conversation history, allowing the agent to maintain context across multiple turns.
5. **Web Search Tool:** The `web_search` node performs searches via the Anthropic API, and is used by the AI Agent to search external information.
6. **Think Tool:** The `Think` node let the agent think about something before giving the final output. It is useful for complex reasoning.
