# Exponential Backoff for Google APIs

## Use cases:

- **Handling Google Sheets API Rate Limits:** When performing bulk operations on Google Sheets, this workflow can automatically retry requests that are throttled due to API usage limits, ensuring data processing continues without manual intervention.
- **Reliable Data Synchronization:** Use this workflow to reliably synchronize data between a system and Google Sheets, automatically retrying API calls if they fail due to temporary network issues or service unavailability.
- **Automated Reporting:** When generating automated reports using Google Sheets API, this workflow can ensure that the reporting process completes successfully, even if the API experiences intermittent errors.

## How it works:

1.  The workflow starts with a **"When clicking ‘Test workflow’"** node, which initiates the process manually.
2.  The **"Loop Over Items"** node processes data in batches.
3.  The **"Google Sheets"** node attempts to perform an operation on a Google Sheet (e.g., reading or writing data). If this fails due to a rate limit or other error, the workflow continues to the next node due to `onError: "continueErrorOutput"`.
4.  The **"Exponential Backoff"** node calculates the wait time for the next retry attempt. It implements an exponential backoff strategy, increasing the delay with each retry. The retry count is stored and incremented in each iteration.
5.  The **"Wait"** node pauses the workflow for the calculated duration, allowing the Google Sheets API rate limits to reset.
6.  The **"Check Max Retries"** node checks if the maximum number of retries has been exceeded.  If the retry count is greater than 10, it goes to the "Stop and Error" node. Otherwise, the workflow loops back to the **"Google Sheets"** node to retry the operation.
7.  If the maximum number of retries is reached, the **"Stop and Error"** node halts the workflow and issues an error message, indicating that the Google Sheets API limit has been triggered.
