# My Workflow

## Use cases:

*   **Get the latest news from Hacker News:** Stay up-to-date with the most recent and popular stories on Hacker News without manually browsing the site.
*   **Simple Hacker News feed:** Create a basic workflow to fetch and process the latest Hacker News content for further analysis or integration into other systems.

## How it works:

The workflow is triggered manually by clicking the "execute" button in n8n.  Once triggered, it uses the "Hacker News" node to fetch the latest stories from Hacker News. The "Hacker News" node retrieves the information and passes it along for further processing or display (though no further processing is defined in this example).

## Services:

*   Hacker News API
