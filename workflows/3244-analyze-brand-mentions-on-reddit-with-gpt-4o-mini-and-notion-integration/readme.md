# Reddit Brand Monitoring & Content Management Workflow

## Use Cases
1. **Automated brand mention tracking** - Monitor Reddit for mentions of your brand/product and analyze sentiment
2. **Content moderation workflow** - Systematically process social media posts and maintain a clean brand presence
3. **AI-powered content analysis** - Use language models to process user-generated content and generate insights

## How it Works
This workflow combines social media monitoring with AI analysis and database management:

1. **Scheduled Trigger** initiates the process at specified intervals
2. **Reddit Search** nodes scan for brand-related posts and comments
3. **AI Processing** (OpenAI) analyzes content for sentiment/key insights
4. **Deduplication System** checks for existing entries using Notion database
5. **Automated Reporting** sends processed data to Notion for record-keeping
6. **Error Handling** nodes manage misspelled brand mentions and duplicates

Key nodes include:
- Reddit search nodes for content collection
- OpenAI language model for text analysis
- Notion integration for data storage
- Deduplication system with merge/exclusion logic

## Services
- **Reddit** (Social media platform)
