## How it Works
1. A user sends a message via the **Chat Trigger** node to initiate the conversation.
2. The **AI Agent** (powered by GPT-4o) processes the query and consults the **Simple Memory** node to retain chat context.
3. The workflow retrieves Brave Search tools via **MCP Get Brave Tools** and executes specific searches using **MCP Execute Brave Search** based on the AI's analysis.
4. GPT-4o synthesizes the search results and chat history to generate a contextual response for the user.

Key nodes include the `lmChatOpenAi` (GPT-4o) for language processing, `mcpClientTool` nodes for Brave Search integration, and `memoryBufferWindow` for short-term conversation tracking.
