# Daily Cartoon (w/ AI Translate)

## Use cases:

-   **Automated Daily Comic Posting:** Automatically fetch the daily Calvin and Hobbes comic strip, translate the dialogues into multiple languages, and post it to a Discord channel for community engagement.
-   **Multi-lingual Educational Content:** Provide language learners with translated comics, aiding in vocabulary acquisition and cultural understanding through a fun and engaging medium.
-   **Content Creation Automation:** Streamline content creation for social media by automating the process of retrieving, translating, and publishing daily comics, saving time and effort for content creators.

## How it works:

1.  **Schedule Trigger:** The workflow starts with a `Schedule Trigger` node, configured to run daily at 9 AM.
2.  **Parameter Setup:** The `param` node sets the current year, month, and day using the `$now` function to generate the correct date format for the comic's URL.
3.  **HTTP Request:** An `HTTP Request` node fetches the HTML content of the Calvin and Hobbes comic page from the gocomics.com website, using the date parameters set in the previous node.
4.  **Information Extractor:** The `Information Extractor` node parses the HTML content received from the HTTP Request node. It extracts the URL of the comic image from the `<img class="img-fluid Lazyloaded">` tag.
5.  **OpenAI:** This node takes the extracted comic image URL and analyzes the image to translate comic dialogues to English and Korean, using the GPT-4o-mini model.
6.  **Discord:** Finally, the `Discord` node posts a message to a specified Discord channel. The message includes the date, the URL of the comic image, and the translated dialogues generated by the OpenAI node.
