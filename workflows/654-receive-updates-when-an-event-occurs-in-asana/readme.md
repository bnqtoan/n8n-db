# Receive updates when an event occurs in Asana

## Use cases:

*   **Project Monitoring:** Get notified instantly when a new task is added to a specific Asana project, allowing for immediate review and assignment.
*   **Status Updates:** Receive alerts when a task's status changes (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress" or "Completed"), providing real-time visibility into project progress.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered by events in Asana. The "Asana Trigger" node listens for changes related to `Tweets` within the `Engineering` workspace.  Whenever an event related to this resource occurs, the workflow starts.  *Note:  This workflow currently only has a trigger, and no actions will occur after the trigger fires.*

## Services:

*   Asana
