# Dynamically Generate HTML Page from User Request Using OpenAI Structured Output

## Use cases:

-   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly generate HTML mockups for web pages based on user-defined requirements, facilitating faster design iterations and client feedback.
-   **Dynamic Content Generation:** Automatically create web pages or sections of pages with layouts and content driven by user input and AI-generated design elements.
-   **Educational Tool:** Demonstrate the practical application of AI in web development, allowing users to visualize their ideas as functional HTML structures.

## How it works:

1.  **Webhook Trigger:** The workflow starts with a Webhook node, which listens for incoming HTTP requests containing a "query" parameter. This parameter contains the user's request for a webpage (e.g., "a signup form").
2.  **OpenAI - Using Structured Output:** The user's query is sent to OpenAI's `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model via an HTTP Request node. The model is instructed to act as a UI designer and copywriter, generating a JSON-formatted output representing the UI components. The JSON schema enforces a specific structure for the HTML elements and their attributes using Tailwind CSS classes.
3.  **OpenAI - JSON to HTML:** The JSON output from the previous step is passed to another OpenAI node, which converts the JSON structure into HTML code.
4.  **Format the HTML result:** This node takes the HTML generated and wraps it in a basic HTML document structure, including a link to the Tailwind CSS CDN and setting the title.
5.  **Respond to Webhook:** The generated HTML content is sent back as the response to the initial webhook request, with the `Content-Type` header set to `text/html`.

## Services:

-   OpenAI API: Utilized for both generating the structured UI in JSON format and converting the JSON into HTML.
