# Convert Image Files to URLs and Reduce File Size

## Use cases:
- Automatically generate and optimize images for blog posts or social media content, reducing file size while hosting them online.
- Create a workflow to optimize and host user-uploaded images on a website, ensuring faster loading times and reduced bandwidth usage.
- Integrate with a content management system (CMS) to automatically optimize and upload images when new content is published.

## How it works:
1.  **Set image description (Optional):** This node allows you to input a description to prompt and create an Image using OpenAI.
2.  **Generate Image (Optional):** Based on the description, the node uses OpenAI to generate an image.
3.  **Upload Img to ImgBB for URL:** The workflow uploads the generated (or provided) image to ImgBB, a free image hosting service, to obtain a shareable URL.
4.  **ReSmush.it Image Optimisation:**  Takes the image URL and optimizes the image, reducing its file size using ReSmush.it.
5.  **Store Optimised Image ImgBB:** Uploads the optimized image to ImgBB.
6.  **No Operation, do nothing:** Workflow ends
