# MCP_GMAIL

## Use cases:

- **Automated Email Interactions with AI Assistance:** Allow users to interact with Gmail using natural language through an AI tool. The AI tool determines the appropriate action (send, reply, get email) and extracts necessary information.
- **AI-Powered Email Management:** This workflow can be integrated into a larger AI system to automate email tasks based on user requests. For example, a user can ask the AI to "send an email to John about the meeting" or "get the latest email from Jane."
- **Smart Email Notifications and Responses:** Triggered by an AI, the workflow can get an email based on predefined rules, extract information, and use that to send or reply to another email.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered by the "MCP_GMAIL" node, which is an n8n Langchain MCP Trigger that listens for requests on the `/mcp/:tool/gmail` path. Based on this trigger, the workflow can execute a variety of Gmail operations, including:

1.  **GET_EMAIL:** Retrieves an email using a provided `Message_ID` and simplifies the response if requested.
2.  **SEND_EMAIL:** Sends a new email to a specified recipient (`sendTo`) with a given subject and message.
3.  **REPLY_EMAIL:** Replies to an existing email (identified by `Message_ID`) with a specified message.
4.  **SEND_AND_WAIT:** Sends an email and waits for a response.

The workflow leverages the Gmail OAuth2 credential for authentication, allowing it to securely access and manipulate Gmail data. All nodes, GET_EMAIL, SEND_EMAIL, REPLY_EMAIL and SEND_AND_WAIT are connected to the trigger node "MCP_GMAIL"
