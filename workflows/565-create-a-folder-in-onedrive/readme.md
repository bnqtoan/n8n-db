# Create Folder in Microsoft OneDrive

## Use cases

*   Automatically create a new folder in your OneDrive account when a specific trigger occurs in another system. For example, when a new project is created in a project management tool.
*   Create a folder structure within OneDrive based on data received from a form submission, ensuring organized file storage.

## How it works

This workflow is triggered manually by clicking the "execute" button in n8n.  Upon execution, it creates a new folder named "n8n-rocks" in your Microsoft OneDrive account using the configured credentials. The Microsoft OneDrive node uses the "create" operation on the "folder" resource.
