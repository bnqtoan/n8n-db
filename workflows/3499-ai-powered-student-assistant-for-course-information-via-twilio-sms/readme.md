# My Workflow

## Use cases:

- **Course Information via SMS:** Allows students to inquire about course schedules, instructors, or departments via SMS and receive automated responses.
- **Automated Student Support:** Provides immediate answers to common course-related questions, reducing the workload on human staff.
- **Lead Generation:** Logs student inquiries and the agent's responses in an Airtable base, which can be analyzed for potential leads or to improve the chatbot's accuracy.

## How it works:

1.  **Twilio Trigger:** The workflow starts when an SMS message is received via a Twilio webhook.
2.  **Get User Message:** Extracts the message body and sender's information (phone number) from the Twilio payload.

4.  **Get Course Database Schema:** Retrieves the schema of the Airtable course database.
5.  **Search Available Courses:** Searches the Airtable course database based on a filter generated by the Agent.
6.  **Get List of Professors:** Gets a list of active professors on Airtable.
7.  **Get List of Departments:** Gets a list of departments on Airtable.
8.  **Append to Call Log:** The Agent's output is logged in an Airtable base.
9.  **Send SMS reply:** Sends the agent's response back to the user via SMS using Twilio.
