# Tesla Quant Technical Indicators Webhooks Tool n8n

## Use cases:

- **Real-time Technical Analysis:** Get up-to-date technical indicator data for Tesla stock at various intervals (15 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day) to inform trading decisions.
- **Algorithmic Trading:** Integrate the workflow with automated trading systems to trigger buy/sell orders based on the values of technical indicators.
- **Market Monitoring Dashboard:** Feed the technical indicator data into a dashboard for a comprehensive overview of Tesla's stock performance and market trends.

## How it works:

This workflow acts as an API data fetcher for Tesla (TSLA) technical indicators across three timeframes: 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day. It consists of three main branches, each corresponding to a different timeframe.

1.  **Webhook Trigger:** Each timeframe has a dedicated webhook that serves as the entry point.  When an external workflow triggers the webhook (e.g., `/15minData`, `/1hourData`, `/1dayData`), the workflow execution begins.
2.  **Data Fetching:**  Upon being triggered, the workflow makes six HTTP requests to the Alpha Vantage API, fetching data for the following technical indicators: RSI, MACD, BBANDS, SMA, EMA, and ADX.  Each HTTP request is configured with the appropriate Alpha Vantage API endpoint for the specific indicator and timeframe.  Authentication is handled using the "Alpha Vantage Premium" credential stored in n8n.
3.  **Data Formatting:**  The raw JSON data received from Alpha Vantage is then processed by a series of "Code" nodes. These nodes extract the latest 20 data points for each indicator and reformat the data into a consistent JSON structure containing the indicator name, timeframe, and the cleaned data.  The formatting logic is customized for each indicator to handle differences in the API's response structure.
4.  **Data Merging:**  The formatted data for all six indicators within a timeframe is then merged into a single JSON object using a "Merge" node.
5.  **Webhook Response:** Finally, the merged data is sent back to the calling workflow via a "Respond to Webhook" node.
