# Telegram Content Creator with AI Agent

## Use cases:

*   **Automated Social Media Management:** Automatically create social media content, including engaging text and image prompts, based on user-defined topics received via Telegram.
*   **Voice-to-Social Media Conversion:** Transcribe voice messages received on Telegram into text and then generate social media content and image prompts.
*   **Content Idea Generation:** Quickly generate content ideas and image prompts for social media platforms using an AI agent triggered by a simple Telegram message.

## How it works:

1.  **Receive Telegram Messages:** The workflow starts by listening for new messages sent to a Telegram bot.
2.  **Voice or Text?**: The switch node checks if the telegram message has a voice or a text to choose the proper path to follow.
3.  **Fetch Voice Message (if audio):** If the message is a voice note, it retrieves the audio file from Telegram.
4.  **Transcribe Voice to Text (if audio):** The audio is transcribed into text using OpenAI's Whisper API.
5.  **Prepare for LLM (if text):** If the message is text, it stores it in a variable to feed to the LLM.
6.  **AI Agent:** The core of the workflow is the AI Agent, which uses:
    *   An OpenAI Chat Model configured with a specific system message to act as a social media content creator.
    *   SerpAPI for researching the given topic.
    *   A Structured Output Parser to ensure the AI Agent's output is in a consistent JSON format, including both social media content text and a detailed image prompt.
7.  **Generate Image:** The image prompt generated by the AI Agent is used to generate an image using the Hugging Face API, utilizing a Stable Diffusion model.
8.  **Extract from File:** This converts the image from a binary file to a readable format.
9.  **Prepare Final Output:** Combines the social media content and the generated image data into a final output structure.
10. **End:** The workflow ends by outputting the final content and image.
