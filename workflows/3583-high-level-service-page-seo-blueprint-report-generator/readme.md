## Use cases:

## How it works:

This workflow automates the process of creating a detailed SEO blueprint for service pages. It begins by collecting input from a form, including competitor URLs, the target keyword, services offered, the brand name, and whether the page is a homepage. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Collects Input:** The workflow starts with a form trigger to gather essential details, including competitor URLs, target keyword, services offered, brand name, and homepage status.
2.  **Fetches and Extracts HTML:** It fetches the HTML content from the URLs and extracts relevant information such as headings, meta tags, and schema data.
3.  **Analyzes Competitor Data:** The workflow analyzes the extracted HTML to identify common outline sections, keywords, and structural elements used by competitors.
4.  **Determines User Intent:** Based on the target keyword, the workflow analyzes user intent, including primary goals, related questions, and the buyer's journey stage.
5.  **Synthesizes Insights:** It synthesizes competitor analysis and user intent to identify content overlaps, gaps, and SEO keyword/topic priorities.
6.  **Generates Page Outline:** The workflow generates a recommended page outline with a compelling H1, logical section flow (H2s), and detailed subsections (H3s/H4s).
7.  **Enhances UX and Conversion:** Actionable recommendations are layered on the recommended page outline to maximize user experience, conversions, and persuasive communication.
8.  **Creates Final Blueprint:** Finally, the workflow compiles all analyses and recommendations into a comprehensive and actionable service page blueprint in Markdown format. The blueprint is then converted to a text file for easy access.
