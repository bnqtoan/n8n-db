# My Workflow

## Use cases:
- Convert date formats: Transform dates from one format (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY) to another format supported by n8n or other services.
- Initialize date values: Set a specific date as a starting point for more complex workflows or data processing tasks.

## How it works:
The workflow starts with a manual trigger, which is activated when the user clicks the "execute" button in n8n.  Upon execution, the workflow proceeds to the "Date & Time" node. This node is configured to initialize the date to `14/02/2020`, interpreting it according to the specified format `DD/MM/YYYY`.

## Services:
- None. This workflow does not interact with any external services or tools.
