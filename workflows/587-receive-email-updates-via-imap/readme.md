# IMAP Email Workflow

## Use cases:

- **Email Archiving:** Automatically archive emails from a specific IMAP inbox to a designated storage location.
- **Email Notifications:** Trigger notifications in other applications (e.g., Slack, Discord) based on new emails received in an IMAP inbox.
- **Email-Based Task Creation:** Create tasks in a project management tool (e.g., Todoist, Asana) based on the content of incoming emails.

## How it works:

This workflow is designed to interact with an IMAP email server. It consists of a single node:

1.  **IMAP Email:** This node connects to an IMAP server using the provided credentials and retrieves emails. The `allowUnauthorizedCerts` option is set to `false`, ensuring a secure connection.

Because the workflow is incomplete (no connections defined), the current implementation only reads the emails. To make the workflow more useful, you need to add more nodes to actually *do* something with the emails it retrieves, such as sending them to another service or saving the content to a file.
