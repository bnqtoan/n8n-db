# Create new Clickup Tasks from Slack commands

## Use cases:

- **Quick Task Creation:** Streamline task creation by allowing team members to create ClickUp tasks directly from Slack using slash commands, eliminating the need to switch between platforms.
- **Meeting Action Items:** During Slack discussions, quickly convert action items into ClickUp tasks by using a slash command with the task description, ensuring nothing is forgotten.
- **Incident Reporting:** Enable users to report incidents or bugs directly from Slack, automatically creating tasks in ClickUp for the development or support team.

## How it works:

1.  **Receives slack command:** The workflow starts when a Slack slash command is received via a webhook. The webhook listens for POST requests sent to a specific endpoint.
2.  **Set your nodes:** Extracts data from the Slack command payload, including the channel name, command, user name, and the text (task description). These values are assigned to variables for later use.
3.  **Create new clickup task:** Creates a new task in ClickUp using the extracted information.  The task name and content are set to the text from the Slack command. It uses OAuth2 authentication to connect to ClickUp.
4.  **Respond to Webhook:** Sends a response back to Slack confirming that the task has been created, including the ID of the newly created ClickUp task.
