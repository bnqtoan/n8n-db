# My Workflow

## Use cases:

*   **AI-Powered Question Answering:** This workflow can be used to answer questions using a Language Model (LLM) and tools like Wikipedia for information retrieval.
*   **Custom AI Agent:** Develop an AI agent that can respond to user prompts, leveraging an LLM and custom tools for specific tasks like searching Wikipedia.
*   **Educational Tool:** Create an interactive learning experience where users can ask questions and receive answers generated by an AI, supplemented by information from external resources.

## How it works:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow starts when the "Execute Workflow" button is clicked.
2.  **Set Initial Query:** Two "Set" nodes ("Set2" and "Set3") define initial queries: "Tell me a joke" and "What year was Einstein born?" respectively.
3.  **LLM Chain (Joke):** The "Set2" node's query is passed to a "Custom - LLM Chain Node1". This node uses a Langchain prompt template and an OpenAI Chat Model ("OpenAI Chat Model") to generate a joke.
    *   The "OpenAI Chat Model" node is configured to use the "gpt-4o-mini" model.
4.  **AI Agent (Einstein):** The "Set3" node's query is passed to an "AI Agent" node. This agent uses an OpenAI Chat Model ("OpenAI Chat Model1") and a custom Wikipedia tool ("Custom - Wikipedia1") to find the birth year of Einstein.
    *   The "OpenAI Chat Model1" node is configured to use the "gpt-4o-mini" model.
    *   The "Custom - Wikipedia1" node searches Wikipedia and returns relevant information.
5.  **Custom Wikipedia Tool:** The "Custom - Wikipedia1" node utilizes the WikipediaQueryRun tool from the Langchain library to query Wikipedia based on the input query. The results are then passed back to the AI Agent.

## Services:

*   **OpenAI:** Used via the OpenAI Chat Model nodes for language processing and text generation.
*   **Wikipedia:** Accessed via the custom "Wikipedia" tool for information retrieval.
