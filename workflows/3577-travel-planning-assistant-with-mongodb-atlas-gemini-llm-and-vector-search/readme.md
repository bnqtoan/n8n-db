# Travel AssistantAgent

## Use cases:

- **Personalized Travel Recommendations:** Users can ask the agent for travel suggestions based on their interests (e.g., "Where should I go for a romantic getaway?"), and the agent will leverage its knowledge base of points of interest to provide tailored recommendations.
- **Real-time Information Retrieval:** The agent can provide up-to-date information about points of interest, such as descriptions, locations, and other relevant details, assisting users in making informed decisions during their trip planning.
- **Dynamic Trip Planning:**  The agent can integrate with external services (not explicitly shown but implied in the architecture) to book reservations, check availability, and manage other aspects of trip planning based on user preferences and real-time data.

## How it works:

1.  **Chat Trigger:** The workflow is initiated when a chat message is received via the "When chat message received" trigger node.
2.  **AI Agent:** The message is sent to the "AI Traveling Planner Agent" node, which is configured with a system message defining its role as a helpful trip planning assistant. The agent is instructed to use its vector search capabilities.
3.  **Memory:** The "MongoDB Chat Memory" node is used to store and retrieve conversation history, enabling the agent to maintain context and provide more relevant responses over time.
4.  **Language Model:** The "Google Gemini Chat Model" node processes the input and generates a response based on the user's query and the available tools.
5.  **Vector Search:** The "MongoDB Atlas Vector Store" node acts as a tool for the agent, allowing it to search for points of interest based on semantic similarity. The vector store retrieves relevant information based on the user's query.
6.  **Data Ingestion (Separate Flow):**
    *   A webhook ("Webhook" node) receives data about new points of interest via a POST request to the `/ingestData` endpoint.  The request body should contain a JSON object with the point of interest's title and description.
    *   The "Default Data Loader" node extracts the title and description from the JSON payload.
    *   The "MongoDB Atlas Vector Store1" node then inserts the new data into the `points_of_interest` collection in MongoDB Atlas, using embeddings generated by the "Embeddings OpenAI1" node. This keeps the vector store up-to-date.
7.  **Embeddings:** The OpenAI embedding nodes convert the text in vectors before insert and retrieval.

## Services:

-   **Google Gemini API:**  Used for the language model to generate responses.
-   **MongoDB Atlas:**  Used as a vector store and chat memory database to store points of interest and conversation history.
-   **OpenAI API:** Used for generating embeddings for vector search.
