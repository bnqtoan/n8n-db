# Zoho CRM Data Retrieval Workflow

## Use cases:

*   **Data Backup:** Regularly extract all data from Zoho CRM to create backups for data security and disaster recovery.
*   **Data Analysis:** Retrieve all records from Zoho CRM and load them into a data warehouse or analytics platform for reporting and business intelligence.
*   **Data Migration:** Fetch all data from Zoho CRM to migrate it to another CRM system or database.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered manually.  When executed, it connects to Zoho CRM and retrieves all records using the "getAll" operation. The fetched data can then be used for backup, analysis, or migration purposes by connecting subsequent nodes.
