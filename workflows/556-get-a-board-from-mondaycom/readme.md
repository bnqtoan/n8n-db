# Get Items from Monday.com Board

## Use cases:

*   **Retrieve project status:** Automatically fetch the latest status of tasks or projects from a specific Monday.com board for reporting or monitoring purposes.
*   **Data synchronization:** Regularly extract data from a Monday.com board to synchronize it with other systems, like a database or a spreadsheet, ensuring data consistency across platforms.
*   **Trigger downstream processes:** Use the retrieved Monday.com data to trigger other workflows, such as sending notifications based on status changes or creating reports.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered manually by clicking the "execute" button. Once triggered, it connects to a Monday.com board using the provided board ID and retrieves items from that board.  The workflow uses the "Monday.com" node to perform the 'get' operation to fetch board items.

1.  **On clicking 'execute'**: This node initiates the workflow when manually executed.
2.  **Monday.com**: This node connects to your Monday.com account (using the "monday" credential) and retrieves items from the board with the ID "663435997". The "get" operation is used to fetch the data.
