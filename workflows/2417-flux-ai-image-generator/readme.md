## Use cases

-   **AI-Powered Art Generation:** Generate unique and visually striking images based on text prompts and a selection of artistic styles. Useful for artists, designers, and content creators looking for inspiration or to quickly produce assets.
-   **Custom Content Creation for Social Media:** Create engaging and shareable visual content tailored to specific themes or aesthetics. Ideal for social media managers and marketers who need fresh content regularly.
-   **Rapid Prototyping of Visual Concepts:** Quickly visualize and iterate on design ideas by generating images based on different textual descriptions and styles. Useful for designers and product developers in the early stages of concept development.

## How it works

1.  **Form Submission:** The workflow starts with a user submitting a form via a webhook (`n8n Form Trigger`). The form captures two key pieces of information: a text prompt describing the desired image and a selection of the style ( "Hyper-Surreal Escape", "Neon Fauvism", "Post-Analog Glitchscape", "AI Dystopia", "Vivid Pop Explosion").
2.  **Style Routing:** Based on the selected style, the `Route by style` node directs the workflow to the appropriate `Set` node, which assigns a specific `stylePrompt` variable. This variable contains detailed instructions for the AI model, including artistic techniques, color palettes, and rendering settings.
3.  **AI Image Generation:** The `Call hugginface inference api` node sends the combined text prompt and style prompt to a Hugging Face model (FLUX.1-schnell). This model generates an image based on the provided instructions.
4.  **Image Hosting:** The generated image is then uploaded to an S3-compatible storage service (Cloudflare R2) using the `Upload image to S3` node. The filename includes the n8n execution ID.
5.  **Webpage Response:** The `Serve webpage` node responds to the form submission by displaying a webpage. The webpage shows the generated image, its style, and a link to duplicate the workflow. It also attempts to display the last 4 renders, but these may error if they do not exist. If any error occurs in the `Call hugginface inference api` the `Respond with error` node will trigger.

## Services

-   **Hugging Face Inference API:** Used to generate images from text prompts and style instructions.
-   **Cloudflare R2 (or any S3-compatible storage):** Used to store the generated images.
