## Readme for n8n Workflow: Greeting Workflow

This workflow automates a personalized greeting based on data received from a webhook.

### Use cases:

1.  **Personalized Event Invitations:** Send customized greetings to individuals based on event details, making invitations more engaging.
2.  **Welcome Messages:** Create tailored welcome messages for users signing up for a service or attending a webinar.
3.  **Custom Notifications:** Deliver personalized notifications with specific details based on the context of the notification.

### How it works:

1.  **Webhook Trigger:** The workflow starts with a "Webhook" node that listens for incoming HTTP requests at the specified path (`/greetinghook`).
2.  **Data Transformation (FunctionItem):** The "FunctionItem" node receives the data from the webhook. It extracts the `name` and `event` parameters from the query string of the request.  It then constructs a personalized greeting message like "Hello [name], have fun at the [event]!".
3.  **HTTP Request:** The "HTTP Request" node takes the generated greeting from the "FunctionItem" node and sends it as a POST request to a specified webhook URL (`https://webhook.site/c0a47a6f-6a71-4d18-baef-51f694f7c56b`). This simulates sending the greeting to an external service or application. The `bodyParametersUi` configures the "greeting" key for sending data.
