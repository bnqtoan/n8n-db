# Build your own PostgreSQL MCP server(No visuals)

## Use cases:

- **Chatbot with Database Interaction:** Enables a chatbot to interact with a PostgreSQL database, allowing users to query, create, update, and delete records through natural language.
- **Automated Data Management:** Facilitates automated data management tasks, such as creating reports, updating records based on specific conditions, or extracting and transforming data from the database.
- **AI-Powered Data Assistant:** Serves as the backbone for an AI-powered data assistant capable of understanding user requests and executing them against a PostgreSQL database, improving data accessibility for non-technical users.

## How it works:

This workflow sets up a PostgreSQL MCP (Model-Controller-Persistence) server without visual elements, allowing an AI agent to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

1.  **Triggers:** The workflow is initiated by two main triggers:
    *   `When chat message received`: Listens for chat messages via webhook, triggering the AI agent.
    *   `When Executed by Another Workflow`: Allows the workflow to be triggered by another n8n workflow, receiving commands to perform database operations.

2.  **AI Agent (Langchain):** An AI Agent node uses a language model (Anthropic Chat Model) and memory (Simple Memory) to process user requests and interact with the database.
    *   `Anthropic Chat Model`: Powers the AI agent's natural language understanding and generation.
    *   `Simple Memory`: Remembers previous interactions to provide context for subsequent requests.

3.  **PostgreSQL MCP Server:** This is the core component, implemented using `PostgreSQL MCP Server` that exposes various tools to the AI agent:
    *   `GetTableSchema`: Retrieves the schema of a specified table.
    *   `ListTables`: Lists available tables in the database.
    *   `ReadTableRows`: Reads rows from a specified table.
    *   `CreateTableRecords`: Creates new records in a table.
    *   `UpdateTableRecords`: Updates existing records in a table.
    *   `get table details`: Retrieves table details for a given table.

4.  **Database Operations:** Based on the AI Agent's output, specific database operations are performed. The `Operation` node switches between creating, reading, or updating records:
    *   `ReadTableRecord`: Reads a specific record from a table.
    *   `CreateTableRecord`: Creates a new record in a table.
    *   `UpdateTableRecord`: Updates an existing record in a table.

5. **AI Tool Orchestration**: Using the `Think` node, the workflow organizes different tools to perform tasks related to interacting with a PostgreSQL database, acting as ai_tool.

## Services:

-   **PostgreSQL:** The workflow directly interacts with a PostgreSQL database.
-   **Anthropic:** Utilizes the Anthropic Chat Model for natural language processing.
-   **Langchain:** Uses the Langchain framework for AI agent implementation.
