## Trello List Change Notification Workflow

This workflow automates notifications when changes occur in a specific Trello list.

**Use cases:**

*   **Project Monitoring:** Get notified instantly when a task is moved to a different stage in your Trello project, allowing for immediate action.
*   **Team Collaboration:** Keep team members informed about progress by automatically notifying a channel when tasks are updated in Trello.
*   **Personal Task Management:** Receive updates on your personal to-do list in Trello to stay on top of your priorities.

**How it works:**

The workflow starts with a "Trello Trigger" node.  This node monitors a specified Trello list for any changes (e.g., card added, moved, updated, or deleted).  When a change is detected, the trigger activates the workflow.  Currently, this workflow only includes the trigger.  Further nodes would need to be added to process the triggered data (e.g., sending a notification).
