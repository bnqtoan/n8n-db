# Building an AI-Powered Web Data Pipeline with n8n, Scrapeless, and Claude

## Use Cases

- **Automated Content Aggregation:** Scrape news articles or blog posts from specified websites, extract key information, and store it in a vector database for semantic search.
- **E-commerce Product Monitoring:** Monitor product details (price, availability, description) from online stores, and receive alerts when changes occur.
- **Research and Data Analysis:** Collect data from multiple web sources, structure it, and analyze it using AI to identify trends or patterns.

## How it Works

This workflow automates the process of extracting data from websites, structuring it with AI, and storing it in a vector database. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow is manually triggered using the "When clicking 'Test workflow'" node.
2.  **Check Qdrant Collection:** Checks if a Qdrant collection named "hacker-news" exists. If not, it creates one.
3.  **Set Variables:** The "Set Fields - URL and Webhook URL" node is intended for configuring the target URL to scrape, the Discord webhook URL for notifications, and other Scrapeless parameters (though it's currently empty).
4.  **Web Scraping:** The "Scrapeless Web Request" node uses the Scrapeless Web Unlocker to scrape the content from a specified URL (defaulting to `https://news.ycombinator.com/`). It configures the request to render JavaScript and block resource-intensive elements.
5.  **AI-Powered Data Extraction:** The "Claude Data extractor" node utilizes the Claude AI model to extract structured data from the scraped HTML content, formatting it into a JSON structure with fields like title, description, content, and entities.
6. **AI Data Checker:** Uses Claude to extract and format HTML content into structured JSON.
7.  **AI Agent Enhancement:** The "Claude AI Agent" node refines the raw extraction, validating the JSON structure, correcting parsing errors, and enhancing missing data using the Claude AI model.
8.  **Data Formatting:** The "Format Claude Output" node parses the Claude AI response, handling potential errors and ensuring a consistent data structure for downstream processes.
9.  **Vector Embedding Generation:** The "Ollama Embeddings" node generates vector embeddings for the extracted text using the all-minilm model, enabling semantic search capabilities.
10. **Vector Database Storage:** The "Qdrant Vector store" node stores the generated vector embeddings along with metadata in a Qdrant vector database for efficient retrieval.
11. **Webhook Notifications:**  The "Webhook for structured AI agent response" node sends formatted notifications to Discord (and potentially other platforms like Slack, Teams, etc.) regarding the success or failure of the data storage process.
12. **Export Data Webhook:** The "Expot data webhook" node sends the extracted and formatted data to configured webhooks (Discord, Slack, etc.) as a text file attachment, providing a way to access the raw data.
