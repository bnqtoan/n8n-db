# Standup Bot - Read Config

## Use cases:

*   **Configuration Management:** This workflow can be used to read and parse configuration files for other n8n workflows or applications, ensuring consistent settings across different processes.
*   **Dynamic Workflow Configuration:**  It can be used as a sub-workflow to load configuration data at runtime, allowing workflows to adapt to different environments or user preferences without manual modification.

## How it works:

1.  The workflow is triggered manually using the "On clicking 'execute'" node.
2.  The "Read Config File" node reads the content of the `standup-bot-config.json` file located at `/home/node/.n8n/standup-bot-config.json`. The file's content is stored in a binary format under the `config` property.
3.  The "Convert to JSON" node converts the binary data (from the `config` property) into a JSON object, making it accessible for further processing within the workflow. It uses UTF-8 encoding.

## Services:

*   None (This workflow primarily uses n8n's internal nodes to read and process a local file.)
