# Ultimate Gaming AI Agent

## Use cases:

- **Interactive Gaming Assistant:** A user can ask the Telegram bot for game recommendations, strategies, or lore explanations. The AI Agent utilizes its memory and OpenAI to provide relevant and helpful information.
- **Content Generation for Games:** The bot can be prompted to generate stories, character backstories, or even game ideas based on user input and AI processing of images and audio.
- **Personalized Gaming Experience:** By remembering user preferences and past interactions, the AI Agent can tailor its responses and recommendations to provide a more engaging and personalized gaming experience.

## How it works:

1.  **Telegram Trigger:** The workflow starts when a user sends a message to the Telegram bot.
2.  **User Authentication:** Verifies the user's identity using a Code node (note: this needs to be configured with specific Telegram ID validation logic).
3.  **Message Format Selector:** This Switch node determines the type of message received (text, image, sound).
    -   **Image:** If an image is received, the workflow downloads the image using `Telegram Image Download`, extracts information about it using `Get Image Info`, and sends this data to `OpenAI4` for processing.
    -   **Sound:** If a sound is received, the workflow downloads the audio using `Telegram Sound Download` and send this data to `OpenAI2` for processing.
    -   **Text:** If a text is received, goes directly to step 5
4.  **OpenAI Processing:** The image/sound description from `OpenAI4` or `OpenAI2` is processed.
5.  **Set Message:** Formats the message before sending it to the AI Agent.
6.  **Gaming AI Agent:** This Langchain Agent node, powered by an OpenAI Chat Model, processes the user's input. The agent utilizes a Simple Memory node to remember past interactions and provide context-aware responses.
7.  **Telegram:** The agent's response is sent back to the user via Telegram.
