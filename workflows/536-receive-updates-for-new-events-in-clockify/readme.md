# Clockify Trigger

## Use cases:
- Automatically trigger processes when new time entries are added in Clockify, like sending notifications to project managers.
- Use the trigger to monitor team time tracking and generate reports based on new time entries.

## How it works:
This workflow uses the "Clockify Trigger" node to monitor a specific Clockify workspace.  It's configured to check for new time entries every minute. Whenever a new time entry is detected, the workflow is initiated. **Note:** This workflow currently only contains the trigger and needs to be expanded with additional nodes to perform actions based on the triggered events.
