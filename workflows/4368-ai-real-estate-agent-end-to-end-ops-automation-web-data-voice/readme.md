# AI Real Estate Agent: End-to-End Ops Automation (Web, Data, Voice)

## Use cases:

- **Automated Lead Qualification:** Automatically qualify real estate leads coming in through a website or other channels based on their intent and urgency.
- **Proactive Client Engagement:** Initiate automated voice calls to new leads with personalized introductory messages generated by AI.
- **Data-Driven Lead Management:** Centralize and enrich lead data in Google Sheets, including lead scores, summaries, and extracted information, for better tracking and follow-up.

## How it works:

1.  **Lead Capture:** The workflow starts either with a `Webhook` (IncomingLeadWebhook or Webhook - New Lead1) receiving new lead information or a `Schedule Trigger` initiating the process.
2.  **Data Preparation:** Input fields are renamed (`RenameInputFields`), validated for existence (`ValidateMessageExists`), and cleaned (`CleanUserText`).
3.  **Intent Classification:** An AI agent (`ClassifyIntentUrgency` with `OpenAI Chat Model`) classifies the lead's intent and urgency.
4.  **Data Enrichment:** The workflow standardizes fields (`StandardizeFields`) and checks property details using an API (`PropertyCheckAPI`). It then determines if it's a known listing (`IsKnownListing`).
5.  **Lead Scoring:** A lead score is calculated based on various factors (`CalculateLeadScore`).
6.  **Structured Lead Object Creation:** The lead data is structured into a standardized object (`CreateStructuredLeadObject`).
7. **Optional Branch for Web Interaction:** There is a branch starting from `Schedule Trigger` that performs an `HTTP Request` and extracts information using an `AI Agent` with `OpenAI Chat Model2`, leverages external tools like SerpAPI and Calculator, generates a `Google Docs` document and writes data to a `Google Sheets`.
8.  **Voice Call Automation:**
    *   Lead variables are set (`Set Lead Variables`).
    *   A personalized introductory message is generated (`Generate Intro Message`).
    *   The message is converted to voice using `ElevenLabs - Generate Voice`.
    *   A voice call is placed to the lead using `Twilio - Place Call`.
9.  **Further Lead Qualification:** An AI Agent extracts more information from the call transcript (`AI Agent - Extract Lead Info` with `OpenAI Chat Model4`).
10. **Data Handling:**
    *   Extracted values are stored and normalized (`Store Extracted Values`, `Normalize User Data`).
    *   The workflow checks if the lead is interested (`IF Lead Interested`).
    *   A final lead score is assigned (`Assign Lead Score`).
    *   A timestamp is formatted (`Format Timestamp`).
11. **Lead Logging:** Lead information is logged in Google Sheets (`Google Sheets - Log Lead`).
12. **Lead Summary:** An AI Agent creates a lead summary (`AI Agent - Lead Summary` with `OpenAI Chat Model3`).
13. **Summary Logging:** The lead summary is logged in Google Sheets (`Google Sheets - Log Summary`).
