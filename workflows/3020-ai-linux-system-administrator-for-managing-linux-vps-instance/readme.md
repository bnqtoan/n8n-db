# AI Linux System Administrator

## Use cases:
- Remotely manage a Linux Virtual Private Server (VPS) using natural language commands.
- Automate common system administration tasks, such as checking system status, managing files, or installing software.
- Troubleshoot server issues by asking the AI to diagnose problems and suggest solutions via SSH commands.

## How it works:

1.  **Chat Message Received:** The workflow starts when a chat message is received via webhook, acting as the user's input.
2.  **AI SysAdmin Agent:** The AI SysAdmin agent, powered by a ReAct agent, processes the chat input. It's designed to understand the user's intent to manage a Linux VPS system. It uses a detailed prompt to define its role, objectives, and restrictions.
3.  **Basic SSH Commands Tool:** The AI agent can access a tool providing descriptions of basic SSH commands from a website.
4.  **OpenAI Chat Model:** The AI SysAdmin agent utilizes the OpenAI Chat Model (specifically "gpt-4o") to generate appropriate responses and commands based on the user's input and the tool descriptions.
5.  **Execute SSH Tool:** When a command needs to be executed on the VPS, the AI agent uses the "Execute SSH" tool. This tool is a sub-workflow that takes the command generated by the AI agent as input.
6.  **SSH Execution:** The sub-workflow executes the given command on the external VPS using the SSH node, which connects to the server using provided SSH credentials (password authentication).
7.  **Response:** The executed command's output is returned to the AI agent, which interprets the response and provides a user-friendly explanation or result back to the user via the chat interface (though the return is not defined in the workflow, so we are assuming)

## Services:

-   OpenAI: For natural language processing and generating commands.
-   Hostinger Tutorials: (indirectly) For retrieving basic SSH command descriptions.
-   Linux VPS: The target server where SSH commands are executed.
