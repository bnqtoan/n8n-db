# AI Virtual TryOn for WooCommerce Clothing Catalog

## Use cases:

- **Automated Product Visualization:** Automatically generate "virtual try-on" images for new clothing items added to a WooCommerce catalog, enhancing the customer experience and potentially increasing sales.
- **Scheduled Catalog Updates:** Regularly check for new products in a Google Sheet, create try-on images, and update the WooCommerce product listings with the new images on a scheduled basis.
- **On-Demand Image Generation:** Trigger the image generation process manually for specific products or batches of products, allowing for flexibility and control over the image creation process.

## How it works:

This workflow automates the process of creating and updating WooCommerce product images with an AI-powered virtual try-on feature.

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow can be triggered manually or on a schedule.
2.  **Get New Product:** Fetches new product data, including the product image URL, from a specified Google Sheet.
3.  **Set Data:** Prepares the data for the image creation process.
4.  **Create Image:** Sends a request to an external service (likely an AI-powered image processing API) to generate a "virtual try-on" image based on the product image.
5.  **Wait:** Pauses the workflow for 60 seconds to allow the image processing service to complete the task.
6.  **Get Status:** Checks the status of the image creation process using an HTTP request.
7.  **Completed?:** Verifies if the image generation is complete. If not, the workflow loops back to the "Wait" node.
8.  **Get URL Image:** Retrieves the resulting image file from an API.
9.  **Get File Image:** Retrieves the image file.
10. **Upload Image:** Uploads the generated image to Google Drive.
11. **Update Result:** Updates a Google Sheet with the URL of the generated image.
12. **Update product:** Finally, updates the corresponding WooCommerce product listing with the new "virtual try-on" image.

## Services:

-   **WooCommerce:**  The e-commerce platform where product information is updated.
-   **Google Sheets:** Used as a data source for new product information and to store the generated image URLs.
-   **Google Drive:** Used for storing the generated images.
-   **AI Image Processing API:** An external API that performs the AI-powered "virtual try-on" image generation (implementation details not provided, but it interacts with HTTP Request nodes).
