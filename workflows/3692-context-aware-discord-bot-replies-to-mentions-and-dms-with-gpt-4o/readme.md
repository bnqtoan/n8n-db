# AI Discord Bot Respond to Mentions and DMs with Context Awareness

## Use cases:

- **Automated Customer Support:**  The bot can automatically answer common questions in a Discord server, freeing up human support staff.
- **Community Engagement:** The bot can engage with users in a Discord server by responding to mentions and DMs with helpful information, context from past conversations, and relevant resources.
- **Personal Assistant:**  Individuals can use the bot to manage tasks, set reminders, or get quick answers to questions directly within Discord.

## How it works:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow starts either when the bot receives a direct message (DM) through the "DM Received" webhook or when the bot is publicly mentioned via the "Public Mention" trigger.
2.  **Data Mapping:** The "Mapping data for the Agent" node prepares the received data for the AI agent.
3.  **AI Agent:** The "AI Agent" node processes the incoming message using a language model and memory. It uses "OpenAI Chat Model" for language processing, "Simple Memory" to remember past interactions for context, and potentially "Read last public messages" or "Read last private messages" to access recent conversations within the Discord server, and uses the information mapped in step 2 to have relevant data to formulate the response.
4.  **Reply Decision:** The "Either the bot should reply in dm or in public channel" node determines whether the response should be sent via DM or in the public channel.
5.  **Reply:**  The bot sends the generated response either via DM using the "Reply in DM" node or in the public channel using the "Reply in public channel" node. Both "Reply in DM" and "Reply in public channel" use Discord nodes.
