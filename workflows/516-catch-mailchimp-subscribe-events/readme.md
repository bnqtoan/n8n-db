## n8n Workflow: Mailchimp Subscription Trigger

This workflow automatically triggers when a new subscriber is added to a specified Mailchimp list.

**Use cases:**

*   **Welcome Email Automation:** Automatically send a welcome email to new subscribers through a service like SendGrid or Gmail upon subscription.
*   **CRM Integration:**  Add new Mailchimp subscribers to a CRM system like HubSpot or Salesforce.
*   **Data Synchronization:** Update a Google Sheets spreadsheet with new subscriber information for reporting or analysis.

**How it works:**

This workflow starts with a "Mailchimp Trigger" node. This node listens for `subscribe` events on the Mailchimp list with ID `0a5a4ca5de`. The trigger is configured to react to subscriptions originating from the API, admin panel, or user actions.  When a new subscriber is added to the specified list, the workflow is activated.  Currently, there are no connections to subsequent nodes, meaning the workflow only triggers. To make it functional, you need to add more nodes after the trigger to process the new subscriber data.
