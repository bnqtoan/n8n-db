# Enhance Chat Responses with Real-Time Search Data via Bright Data & Gemini AI

## Use cases:

- **Enhanced Customer Support:** Automatically provide customer support agents with real-time search results related to customer queries, improving response accuracy and speed.
- **Real-Time Information Retrieval:** Enable chat applications to answer user questions by fetching and summarizing relevant information from Google, Bing, or Yandex.
- **AI-Powered Research Assistant:** Build a research tool within a chat interface that uses AI to understand research topics, conduct searches, and deliver concise summaries to the user.

## How it works:

1.  **Chat Trigger:** The workflow starts when a message is received in a chat interface (via the "When chat message received" node).
2.  **AI Agent Orchestration:** The "AI Agent" node takes the chat input and uses a system message to define its role as a helpful assistant utilizing Bright Data's MCP Search Engine tools. It uses Google Gemini Chat Model to understand the user's intent.
3.  **Search Engine Selection:** Based on the user's query, the AI Agent determines whether to use the Google, Bing, or Yandex search engine tools provided by the Bright Data MCP Client.
4.  **Real-time Search:** The appropriate MCP Client Tool node (e.g., "Google Search Engine for Bright Data") executes a search query using the specified engine via Bright Data.
5.  **Response and Webhook Notification:** The results from the search engine are passed back to the AI Agent, which formulates a response and performs a webhook notification using the "HTTP Request for Webhook Notification" node.

## Services:

*   **Bright Data MCP Client:** Used to access and utilize the search engine tools (Google, Bing, Yandex) for web scraping.
*   **Google Gemini (PaLM) API:** Utilized for natural language understanding and generating appropriate responses based on the search results.
*   **Webhook:** A generic webhook to send a request to a specified URL (https://webhook.site/daf9d591-a130-4010-b1d3-0c66f8fcf467).
