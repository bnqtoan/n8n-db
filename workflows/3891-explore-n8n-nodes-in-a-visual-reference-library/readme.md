# My Workflow

## Use Cases
- **AI-Powered Data Analysis:** Use AI to process data from various sources, such as Google Sheets or email triggers, extract relevant information, and perform sentiment analysis.
- **Intelligent Automation Hub:** Act as a central hub for automating tasks across multiple applications, leveraging AI for intelligent decision-making and data transformation.
- **Custom AI Agent Creation:** Build custom AI agents with specific tools and memory configurations to perform specialized tasks.

## How it Works
This workflow acts as a comprehensive reference for n8n nodes, particularly those related to AI and data transformation.

1.  **Triggers:** The workflow starts with various trigger nodes, such as Gmail Trigger, Google Sheets Trigger, Webhook, and Schedule Trigger. These nodes initiate the workflow based on specific events or schedules.
2.  **Data Transformation:** Data from the triggers flows into a section with nodes like Edit Fields, Filter, Limit, Remove Duplicates, Split Out, Aggregate, and more. These nodes transform, filter, and manipulate the data as needed.
3.  **AI Agents:** A set of AI agent nodes, including AI Agent, Basic LLM Chain, OpenAI, Information Extractor, Sentiment Analysis, Summarization Chain, and Text Classifier, process the data. These nodes utilize language models and AI tools for tasks like sentiment analysis, summarization, and information extraction.
4.  **AI Tools:** A collection of AI tools, such as Calculator, SerpAPI, Wikipedia, and Wolfram Alpha, along with tools to connect to Google services and databases, are available for the AI agents.
5.  **Vector Memory:** Vector memory nodes, like In-Memory Vector Store, Pinecone Vector Store, and Postgres PGVector Store, help store and retrieve data for AI agents.
6.  **Flow Control:** Nodes like If, Loop Over Items, Wait, and Execute Workflow manage the flow of the workflow, allowing for branching, looping, and execution of other workflows.
7. **App Actions:** A set of Nodes allows interaction with apps.
