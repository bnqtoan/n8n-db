# Rundeck Job Execution Workflow

## Use cases

*   **Automated Infrastructure Tasks:** Execute Rundeck jobs to automate server maintenance, deployments, or other infrastructure-related tasks directly from n8n.
*   **Scheduled Job Triggering:** Use n8n's scheduling capabilities to automatically trigger Rundeck jobs at specific times or intervals, ensuring timely execution of routine tasks.
*   **Event-Driven Automation:** Trigger Rundeck jobs based on events from other services (e.g., a new file uploaded to a cloud storage service), enabling dynamic and responsive automation.

## How it works

This workflow is triggered manually via the "On clicking 'execute'" node. Upon execution, it calls the Rundeck node, which then executes a specified job. The Rundeck node is configured with a job ID (`f02c7661-6f75-4ffe-958c-c0ed5f9bc9e6`) and uses credentials stored under the name `rundeck_creds` to authenticate with the Rundeck server.
