# Research and Content Creation Workflow

## Use Cases
1. **Automated Article Generation**  
   Create comprehensive articles by delegating research tasks to AI agents, organizing content, and sending finalized drafts via email.
   
2. **Collaborative Research Projects**  
   Coordinate multiple AI "researchers" and "editors" to process large documents, extract insights, and structure findings into reports.

3. **Document Understanding System**  
   Automatically process PDFs (possibly via Mistral), analyze content, and generate structured answers to questions through parallel workflows.

## How It Works
This AI-driven workflow:
1. Starts with a **Form Trigger** or external workflow execution
2. Uploads documents to Mistral (via HTTP requests) 
3. Uses a hierarchy of LangChain AI agents:
   - **Research Leader**: Coordinates tasks
   - **Project Planner**: Structures the workflow
   - **Research Assistants**: Handle subtasks in parallel
4. Merges and edits content using OpenRouter language models (o3-mini, gpt4o)
5. Finalizes the output with structured parsing
6. Sends results via **Gmail**

Key nodes include AI workflow tools for PDF processing (`Mistral_PDF`), merge operations for content organization, and multiple stages of AI refinement.

## Services
- **Mistral** (via HTTP requests for document processing)
- **Gmail** (email delivery)
- **OpenRouter** AI models (o3-mini, gpt4o)
