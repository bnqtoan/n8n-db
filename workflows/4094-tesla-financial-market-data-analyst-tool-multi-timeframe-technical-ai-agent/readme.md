## How it works:

This workflow acts as a specialized AI agent designed to analyze financial data for Tesla (TSLA) stock. It starts when triggered by another workflow, specifically the "Tesla Quant Trading AI Agent", receiving a message and session ID as input. The core of the workflow is the "Tesla Financial Market Data Analyst" node, which uses an OpenAI Chat Model (GPT-4) to interpret technical indicators from various timeframes (15min, 1hour, 1day) and candlestick patterns. The workflow calls four "Tool Workflow" nodes to get data from:"Tesla 15min Indicators Tool", "Tesla 1hour Indicators Tool", "Tesla 1day Indicators Tool", and "Tesla 1hour and 1day Klines Tool". The AI agent then synthesizes the data, classifies the technical stance, and returns a JSON output with a trading signal, confidence score, and a breakdown of the analysis by timeframe. Finally, the "Simple Memory" node maintains context across requests within the same session.
