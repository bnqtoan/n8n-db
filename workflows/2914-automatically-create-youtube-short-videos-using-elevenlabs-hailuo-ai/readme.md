# AI Video Generation Workflow

## Use Cases

- **Automated Content Creation:** Generate short videos from text prompts for social media marketing, educational content, or promotional materials.
- **Meme Generation:** Quickly create video memes using trending topics and AI-generated images.
- **Personalized Video Greetings:** Automatically create personalized video messages with AI-generated visuals and voiceovers.

## How it works

This workflow automates the process of generating videos from start to finish. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow is initiated (presumably manually via "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" which is disabled.  A category is set using the "Video Catagory" node, then a transcript is generated using the "Generate Transcript" node, which leverages an external service to turn category into transcript.
2.  **Audio Generation:** The "Fetch Elevenlabs" node uses the transcript to generate an audio file. This audio file is then saved to Google Cloud Storage using the "Save Audio" node and made publicly accessible via the "Map Public Link" node.
3.  **Image Generation:** Simultaneously, the "Open AI Whisper" transcribes a different audio file (from "Download Audio"), while "Create a list of Image Text" create the necessary text to feed the AI Image generation. A list of image descriptions is created, and each is sent through "Split Image" node. Then, each text is sent to a service via "Generate Image Prompt" to create an image prompt.
4.  **Image Processing and Storage:** The generated prompt is used to get the image using "Get Image Base 64", convert to data using the "Convert Base64 to Data" node, and stored in Google Cloud Storage with the "Save Image" node. Only the first image generated will continue the execution, due to the "Limit only first Image to video" node.
5.  **Video Creation:** Audio (generated by Elevenlabs from step 2) and a generated image will be sent to Hailuo AI for combining into a video. The status will be checked via "Get Hailuo Status" until it is available for download via the "Get Hailuo Download Link" node. The resulting video is downloaded through "Download Video" and saved to Google Cloud Storage using "Save Video" node.
6.  **Combining transcript and audio:** The audio transcript will be combined with the video in the "Combine Transcript" node. This is followed by "Map Music and Video", "Create Video" and "Wait1 andynocode combine video" to add the audio to the video.
7.  **Finalization:** The workflow generates captions for the video through "Get Captions" and, after converting it using "JSON to Object", saves all data to a Google Sheet using "Google Sheets" node. The data being saved includes: video URL and its captions.
