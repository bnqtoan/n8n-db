# n8n Workflow: AWS Lambda Execution

## Use cases:

*   **Serverless Function Execution:** Trigger an AWS Lambda function directly from n8n for tasks like data processing, image resizing, or sending notifications without managing servers.
*   **Scheduled Task Automation:** Integrate this workflow into a larger automation to execute Lambda functions based on schedules or events, such as daily data backups or periodic system checks.
*   **Webhook-triggered Processing:** Use a webhook to trigger this n8n workflow, which then executes the AWS Lambda function in response to external events (e.g., form submissions, database changes).

## How it works:

This workflow is straightforward. It starts with a "Manual Trigger" node, meaning it's initiated manually by clicking the "Execute" button in n8n.  Once triggered, it executes an AWS Lambda function. The "AWS Lambda" node is configured to call a specific Lambda function identified by its ARN (Amazon Resource Name). The `aws` credential stores the necessary authentication information to access your AWS account.

## Services:

*   AWS Lambda
