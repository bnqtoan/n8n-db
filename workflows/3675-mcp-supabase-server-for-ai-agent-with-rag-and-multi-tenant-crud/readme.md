# MCP_SUPABASE_AGENT

## Use Cases

- **AI-Powered Customer Support:** Automatically manage and track customer interactions, tasks, and status updates within a Supabase database, leveraging AI to provide contextually relevant information.
- **Intelligent Task Management:** Use an AI agent to manage tasks stored in Supabase, automatically updating task status, retrieving relevant information, and learning from previous interactions.
- **Dynamic Knowledge Base Management:** Create and maintain a dynamic knowledge base within Supabase, where an AI agent can store, retrieve, and update information based on interactions and learned insights.

## How it Works

This workflow orchestrates an AI agent that interacts with a Supabase database. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Trigger (MCP_SUPABASE):** The workflow is initiated by a webhook call. This is the entry point for any incoming data or requests to the AI agent.
2.  **Supabase Table Operations (CREATE/GET/DELETE/UPDATE/GET_MANY):** Multiple nodes interact with different Supabase tables:
    -   `agent_messages`: Stores messages exchanged by the agent.
    -   `agent_tasks`: Manages tasks assigned to or by the agent.
    -   `agent_status`: Tracks the current status of the agent or its operations.
    -   `agent_knowledge`: Stores information learned by the agent.
    For each table, there are nodes to create, retrieve, delete, update, and retrieve multiple rows. This allows the agent to fully manage the data stored in Supabase.
3.  **RAG (Retrieve, Augment, Generate):** The RAG node retrieves relevant information from a Supabase vector store, named "documents," which stores embeddings of the agent's interactions and system instructions. It configures `ITERACOES` tool.
4.  **Embeddings OpenAI:** Generates embeddings for text using OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model. This allows the agent to understand the semantic meaning of text and retrieve similar information from the vector store.

## Services

-   **Supabase:** A Firebase alternative.
-   **OpenAI:** For generating text embeddings.
