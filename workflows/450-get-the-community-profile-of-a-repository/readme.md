## n8n Workflow: GitHub Repository Profile Retrieval

This workflow retrieves profile information for a specific repository on GitHub.

**Use cases:**

*   **Repository Monitoring:** Automatically fetch and store repository details to track changes, updates, or key metrics over time.
*   **GitHub Integration:**  Integrate repository profile data into other workflows or applications, such as dashboards or reports.
*   **Educational Purposes:** Demonstrate how to use the n8n GitHub node to retrieve repository information.

**How it works:**

1.  The workflow starts with a "Manual Trigger" node, which executes the workflow when you click the "Execute Workflow" button in n8n.
2.  The "GitHub" node then fetches the profile information for the specified repository. It's configured to connect to GitHub using the provided credentials and retrieve details about the 'n8n' repository owned by 'n8n-io'.
3.  The data retrieved from GitHub can then be used in subsequent nodes for further processing or integration. (Note: This workflow only retrieves the information.  To be more useful, a further node for storing or displaying the output would be beneficial.)

**Services:**

*   GitHub API
