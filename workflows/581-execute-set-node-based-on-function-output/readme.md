# My Workflow

## Use cases:

*   **Conditional Data Processing:** This workflow can be used to process data differently based on a specific condition. For example, routing customer support tickets to different departments based on priority levels.
*   **A/B Testing:** It can facilitate A/B testing scenarios where different configurations or messages are delivered based on a random or pre-defined condition.
*   **Dynamic Content Creation:** This workflow can dynamically generate content (e.g., personalized emails, web page sections) based on the evaluation of a condition.

## How it works:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow is initiated manually using the "On clicking 'execute'" node.
2.  **Data Generation:** The "Function" node creates two data items, each containing a JSON object with an `id` field set to 0 and 1, respectively.
3.  **Conditional Check:** The "IF" node checks the `id` value from the "Function" node. If the `id` is equal to 0, the workflow proceeds along one path; otherwise, it takes an alternative path.
4.  **Data Setting (Path 1):** If the `id` is 0, the "Set" node sets a variable named `name` to the value "n8n".
5.  **Data Setting (Path 2):** If the `id` is not 0, the "Set1" node sets a variable named `name` to the value "nodemation".

## Services:

*   None (This workflow primarily uses n8n's internal nodes for logic and data manipulation.)
