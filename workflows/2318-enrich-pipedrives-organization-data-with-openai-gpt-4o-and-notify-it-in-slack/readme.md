# Pipedrive Organization Enrichment with GPT-4o and Slack Notification

## Use cases:

- **Automated Lead Enrichment:** Automatically enrich newly created Pipedrive organization entries with detailed information scraped from their website, saving sales teams time and improving data quality.
- **Competitive Analysis:** Identify potential competitors for new organizations by leveraging GPT-4o's knowledge and include this information directly in Pipedrive and Slack notifications.
- **Sales Team Briefing:** Provide sales representatives with a quick overview of a new organization's business, target market, and competitive landscape via Slack, enabling them to personalize their outreach.

## How it works:

1.  **Pipedrive Trigger:** The workflow starts when a new organization is created in Pipedrive. It retrieves the organization's data, including the URL from the custom website field.
2.  **ScrapingBee:** The workflow uses ScrapingBee to retrieve the HTML content of the organization's website.
3.  **OpenAI GPT-4o:** The scraped HTML content is then sent to OpenAI's GPT-4o model.  A system prompt instructs GPT-4o to analyze the content, extract key information about the company's services, target market, and potential competitors, and format the response as HTML.
4.  **Pipedrive Note Creation:** A new note is created within the Pipedrive organization, containing the HTML formatted summary generated by GPT-4o.
5.  **HTML to Slack Markdown Conversion:** The HTML output from OpenAI is converted to Markdown format, and then further converted to Slack-specific Markdown to ensure proper formatting in Slack.
6.  **Slack Notification:** A Slack message is sent to a designated channel, notifying the team about the new organization and including the enriched information.
