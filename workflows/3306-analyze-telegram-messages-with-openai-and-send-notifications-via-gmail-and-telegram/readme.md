3.  **Tool Execution:** Based on the message content, the AI agent selects and executes the appropriate tool to gather information or perform a specific action. For example, if the message is about finding an Airbnb, the Airbnb Search tool is used.
4.  **Notifications:** The agent's output is then sent as notifications via both Gmail and Telegram.
