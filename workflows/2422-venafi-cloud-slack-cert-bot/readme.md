# Venafi Slack CertBot

## Use cases:

- **Automated Certificate Issuance**: Automatically issue certificates for domains with a clean VirusTotal scan, streamlining the CSR process.
- **Manual Approval Workflow**: For domains flagged by VirusTotal, generate a detailed report with AI-driven analysis and send it to a Slack channel for manual review and approval by security operations teams.
- **Centralized Certificate Request Management**: Allow users to request certificates directly from Slack, improving request logging and real-time analysis.

## How it works:

1.  **Slack Interaction**: A user interacts with a Slack command or modal to request a certificate.
2.  **Parse Webhook**: The workflow receives a webhook from Slack and parses the data to extract user inputs, such as the domain name, validity period, and optional notes.
3.  **VirusTotal Analysis**: The domain name is sent to VirusTotal for analysis. The workflow retrieves scan results, including malicious, suspicious, undetected, harmless, and timeout counts, as well as the domain's reputation score.
4.  **Automated Decision**:
    *   If VirusTotal reports no malicious flags, the workflow proceeds to automatically issue a certificate.
    *   If VirusTotal reports any malicious flags, the workflow generates a report using OpenAI.
5.  **Certificate Issuance (Automated)**: If automatically approved, the workflow uses the Venafi TLS Protect Cloud node to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and issue the certificate. A confirmation message is sent to the user in Slack.
6.  **Manual Approval Process**: If manual approval is needed:
    *   **AI Report Generation:** OpenAI summarizes the VirusTotal scan results and assesses the overall risk (Low, Medium, or High).
    *   **Slack Notification**: A message is sent to a designated Slack channel, including the domain, requestor information, VirusTotal results, and an AI-generated risk assessment.
    *   **Manual CSR Generation (if approved)**: If the request is approved, a separate workflow process CSR generation using the Venafi TLS Protect Cloud, and the certificate will be issued, otherwise it will be cancelled.
