# My Workflow

## Use Cases

*   **Generate Social Media Graphics:** Automatically create visually appealing social media posts with customized text and colors.
*   **Personalized Marketing Materials:** Design banners or images for email campaigns or website promotions with dynamic content.
*   **Real-time Image Creation for Notifications:** Generate images with specific messages to be used in alerts or notifications within an application.

## How it Works

This workflow is triggered manually. Upon execution, it sends data to Bannerbear to generate an image based on a specified template. The "Bannerbear" node utilizes the '8BK3vWZJ7Wl5Jzk1aX' template and modifies the "message" element within that template, setting its text, color, and background. The workflow waits for the image to be generated before completing.
