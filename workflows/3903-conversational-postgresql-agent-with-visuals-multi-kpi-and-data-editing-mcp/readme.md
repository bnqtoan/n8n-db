# Build your own PostgreSQL MCP server (visuals capable)

## Use Cases:

*   **AI-Powered Database Interaction:** Enables users to interact with their PostgreSQL database using natural language via an AI agent. For example, asking "What are the top 5 customers by revenue?"
*   **Automated Data Analysis and Visualization:** Automatically generates plots and visualizations of data stored in PostgreSQL based on user queries.
*   **Building a custom chatbot for data management:** Provide customer support or data analysis tools that can access your postgres database with AI.

## How it Works:

This workflow sets up a PostgreSQL Managed Control Plane (MCP) server with visual capabilities, driven by an AI agent. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Triggers:** The workflow starts with two possible triggers:
    *   `When chat message received`: Starts the process when a chat message is received.
    *   `When Executed by Another Workflow`: This allows other workflows to execute specific database operations via the MCP.
2.  **Database Operations (Triggered via Workflow Execution):** If triggered by another workflow, an `Operation` switch node determines which PostgreSQL action to take:
    *   `ReadTableRecord`: Reads a record from a specified table.
    *   `CreateTableRecord`: Creates a new record in a table.
    *   `UpdateTableRecord`: Updates an existing record in a table.
3.  **AI Agent Orchestration:** An `AI Agent` node uses Langchain to process user input, leveraging tools like `GetTableSchema`, `ListTables`, `ReadTableRows`, `CreateTableRecords`, `UpdateTableRecords`, `get table details`, and `Plot tool` to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
4.  **Tool Execution:** The AI Agent uses specified tools to fetch data from PostgreSQL:
    *   `GetTableSchema`, `ListTables`, `ReadTableRows`, `CreateTableRecords`, `UpdateTableRecords`, `get table details`: Retrieves table schema, lists tables, reads table rows and records, creates table records, updates table records, and gets table details.
    *   `Plot tool`: Generates visualization based on data and can trigger the main `PostgreSQL MCP Server`.
5.  **Language Model:** The `Anthropic Chat Model` provides the language processing capabilities for the AI agent.
6.  **Memory:** A `Simple Memory` node allows the AI to remember past interactions.
7.  **MCP Client:** `MCP Client` is a tool to allows the AI agent to manage, control, and interact with various data sources, services, or systems through a unified interface.
8.  **Think:** `Think` is a tool that lets the AI to reason and analyze information before making a decision or taking action.

## Services:

*   **PostgreSQL:** The database being managed.
*   **Langchain:** Framework for building applications powered by language models.
*   **Anthropic:** AI safety and research company that builds AI systems.
