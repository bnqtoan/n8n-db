## n8n Workflow: Email Verification with Hunter.io

This workflow automates the process of verifying the deliverability of an email address using the Hunter.io Email Verifier API.

**Use cases:**

*   **Lead Qualification:** Automatically verify email addresses collected through lead generation forms to ensure data accuracy and improve lead quality.
*   **Email List Cleaning:** Clean existing email lists by identifying and removing invalid or undeliverable email addresses, reducing bounce rates and improving sender reputation.
*   **Account Validation:** Verify user-provided email addresses during account registration to prevent fake or invalid accounts.

**How it works:**

1.  The workflow is manually triggered using the "On clicking 'execute'" node.
2.  The "Hunter" node then uses the Hunter.io API's email verification functionality. It takes an email address as input (`user@example.com` in this example) and validates it against Hunter.io's database.
3.  The result of the email verification (e.g., whether the email is valid or not) is then available for further processing in subsequent nodes (not shown in this basic example). You can then use it to update a database, send a notification, or trigger other actions.
