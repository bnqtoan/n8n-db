## Workflow: Create a User Profile in Vero

This workflow automates the process of creating a new user profile in Vero, a customer engagement platform.

### Use Cases:

*   **New User Onboarding:** Automatically create a Vero profile when a new user signs up on your website or application. This ensures that new users are immediately tracked in Vero for targeted communication.
*   **CRM Integration:**  Create Vero profiles from existing CRM data to consolidate customer information and enable personalized marketing campaigns.
*   **Manual User Creation:**  Quickly create a Vero user profile directly from n8n for testing or specific user management tasks.

### How it Works:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow is initiated manually using the "On clicking 'execute'" node. This is a manual trigger, suitable for testing or on-demand user creation.
2.  **Create User in Vero:** The "Vero" node uses your Vero API credentials to create a new user profile. The `id` parameter allows you to specify a unique identifier for the user.  Additional user properties can be added using the `additionalFields` parameter in the node configuration. The exact fields available depend on your Vero account setup.
