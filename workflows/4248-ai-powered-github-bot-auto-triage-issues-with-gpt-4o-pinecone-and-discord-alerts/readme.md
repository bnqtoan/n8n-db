# Github Issue Assistant

## Use cases:

-   **Automated Issue Triaging:** Automatically analyze new GitHub issues submitted to a repository and provide initial hints or suggestions for contributors or maintainers.
-   **Contextual Help for Developers:** Offer relevant documentation snippets or code examples based on the content of a GitHub issue to help developers understand and resolve problems more efficiently.

## How it works:

1.  The workflow starts with a **Webhook** node that listens for new GitHub issue events.
2.  The **Webhook** node triggers a **Set** node ("CHANGE THESE!!!") and ("These too if you want"), allowing you to set or modify data received from the webhook, likely including issue details.
3.  A **LangChain Agent** node ("Github Issue Hints") act as a smart assistant, leveraging information from different sources to respond to the issue.
4.  **LangChain Vector Store Pinecone** nodes ("Code Vector Read" and "Docs Vector Read") fetch relevant code snippets and documentation based on embeddings generated by "Use Text Embedding 3 LARGE" node.
5.  The **LangChain embeddingsOpenAi** node ("Use Text Embedding 3 LARGE") creates text embeddings for semantic search within the vector stores.
6.  The **LangChain LM Chat OpenAi** node ("4o, 4o-mini, etc1") is used as the language model for the agent.
7.  The agent's response is sent back to GitHub through the **Respond to Webhook** node.
