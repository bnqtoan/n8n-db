# Generate Tiktok/instagram carousels with gpt-image-1 and autopublish

## Use cases:

- **Content Creation Automation:** Automatically generate and post engaging carousels to TikTok and Instagram, saving time and effort for social media managers.
- **Brand Storytelling:** Create a series of visually appealing images based on a narrative, enhancing brand storytelling on social platforms.
- **Marketing Campaign Support:** Quickly produce visual content for marketing campaigns, testing different themes and captions to maximize engagement.

## How it works:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow is manually triggered.
2.  **Set Prompts:** Defines five prompts to be used for generating images, formatted in the style of Studio Ghibli anime. Each prompt represents a slide in the carousel and includes a humorous caption.
3.  **Generate Description:** Uses the LangChain OpenAI node to generate a short caption (â‰¤ 90 characters) for the TikTok and Instagram posts based on the previously defined prompts.
4.  **Set API Variables:** Sets variables for the OpenAI Image API calls, such as the model to use (gpt-image-1), the number of images to generate (1 per prompt), image size (1024x1536), image format (webp), and response format.
5.  **Generate Images (OpenAI - Generate Image X):** Calls the OpenAI Image API five times to generate five images based on the prompts and configurations defined in the previous steps. Each image represents a slide in the carousel. Each call uses the result of the previous generated image to edit it with a new prompt.
6.  **Split Image Outputs (Separate Image Outputs X):** The OpenAI API returns the image data in a JSON format that include the b64 content, so this steps split this content from the other metadata returned.
7.  **Convert to File (Convert to File X):** Converts the base64-encoded image data from the OpenAI API response to a binary file format.
8.  **Rename Images (Change name to photoX):** Renames the binary data of each image to photo1, photo2, photo3, photo4, and photo5 respectively.
9.  **Merge:** Merges the 5 images into a single bundle.
10. **Send as 1 merged file:** Executes a code block in order to merge all binary files into one item, allowing the POST nodes to process it.
11. **Post to Instagram/Tiktok:** Uploads the generated images to Instagram and TikTok using an HTTP request to the `upload-post.com` API.  The caption generated by the OpenAI model is used as the title for the post. For TikTok, the workflow automatically adds music.
