# Hubspot Contacts Extractor with Pagination

## Use cases:

- **Regularly back up HubSpot contacts:** Automate the extraction of contact data from HubSpot to a database or storage service for backup and archival purposes.
- **Synchronize HubSpot contacts with other systems:** Keep contact information consistent across different platforms by extracting data from HubSpot and updating other CRM or marketing automation tools.
- **Analyze HubSpot contact data:** Extract contact data for reporting and analysis in external BI tools, allowing for better understanding of customer behavior and trends.

## How it works:

This workflow retrieves contacts from HubSpot, handling pagination to extract all contacts, even when the response is split across multiple pages.

1.  **On clicking 'execute':** The workflow starts manually upon execution.
2.  **Config URL:** Initializes or updates the URL for the HubSpot contacts API. It starts with the base URL and then uses the "next" URL from the previous API response (if available) to handle pagination.
3.  **HTTP Request:** Sends a GET request to the HubSpot API to retrieve contacts. It uses the URL generated by the "Config URL" node and includes the `hapikey` and `limit` query parameters.  **Note:** Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual HubSpot API key.
4.  **NoOp:** A no-operation node, likely used for debugging or as a placeholder.
5.  **Wait:** Pauses the workflow for 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds). This helps prevent rate limiting issues with the HubSpot API.
6.  **Check if pagination?:** Checks if the HubSpot API response includes pagination information ("paging").  Specifically, it verifies if the `paging` property exists and is not empty.
7.  **Set next URL:** If pagination is present, this node extracts the "next" URL from the response and stores it in a variable called `next`.
8. **Combine all data:**  This function aggregates the "results" from all of the paginated `HTTP Request` calls into a single array of contact objects.
9.  The workflow loops back to the "Config URL" node, using the "next" URL to retrieve the subsequent page of contacts, until all pages are processed. If "Check if pagination?" return false, the workflow goes to "Combine all data" and the workflow ends.
