## n8n Workflow: Create a Company in Salesmate

This workflow automates the process of creating a new company record in Salesmate CRM.

**Use cases:**

*   Quickly create a company record in Salesmate for new clients or leads.
*   Integrate with other systems (e.g., a lead generation form) to automatically create companies in Salesmate upon form submission (requires modification to include input nodes).

**How it works:**

1.  The workflow is manually triggered by clicking the "Execute" button in n8n.
2.  The "Salesmate" node then creates a new company record in Salesmate using the provided credentials and parameters. Currently, the workflow creates a basic company record.  To populate specific fields (name, owner, etc.) you'll need to add data input to the "Salesmate" node or connect it to other nodes that provide the necessary information.
