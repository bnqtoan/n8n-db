# Build an MCP Server with Google Calendar

## Use cases:

- **AI-Powered Calendar Management:** Users can interact with a Google Calendar through a chat interface, where an AI agent understands natural language requests to create, search, update, and delete events.
- **Automated Meeting Scheduling:** Integrate the workflow with other systems to automatically schedule meetings based on specific criteria received through chat, such as availability and participant preferences.
- **Voice-Controlled Calendar:** Connect a voice assistant to the chat trigger, enabling users to manage their Google Calendar hands-free.

## How it works:

1.  **MCP Server Trigger:** The workflow starts with an "MCP Server Trigger" node, which listens for events from an MCP (Message Control Protocol) Server. This trigger is activated via a specific URL.
2.  **Google Calendar Tools:** Based on events received from the MCP Server, the workflow uses Google Calendar tools to perform actions such as:
    *   **SearchEvent:** Searches for existing events.
    *   **CreateEvent:** Creates new events.
    *   **UpdateEvent:** Modifies existing events.
    *   **DeleteEvent:** Removes events.
3.  **AI Agent Interaction:** A separate workflow is triggered by a chat message. The "When chat message received" node initiates this flow.
4.  **AI Processing:** An "AI Agent" node processes the chat message, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) and memory to maintain context. The system message instructs the AI to be a helpful assistant, providing the current date and time for context.
5.  **MCP Client Tool:** The AI Agent uses the "Calendar MCP" tool to interact with the Google Calendar via the MCP Server. The URL from the initial MCP Server Trigger is used to connect the AI Agent to the calendar.
6.  **LLM:** gpt-4o model is used to handle the interaction between the user and the calendar.
