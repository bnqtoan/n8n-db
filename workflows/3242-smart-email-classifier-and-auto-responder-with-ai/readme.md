# Email Management & Response Automation Workflow

## Use Cases
1. **Automated Email Prioritization** - Automatically categorize incoming emails into spam, important, personal, and other categories using AI analysis
2. **Smart Response Handling** - Generate draft replies for priority emails and trigger notifications for urgent requests requiring immediate attention
3. **Workflow Integration** - Connect email management with calendar systems and messaging platforms for unified task handling

## How it Works
1. **Email Ingestion** (Gmail Trigger node) - Monitors Gmail inbox for new messages
2. **AI Analysis** (Azure OpenAI + Sentiment Analysis nodes):
   - Classifies emails into categories: spam, important, personal, promotion, etc.
   - Detects urgency ("needs reply", "call requests") using sentiment analysis
3. **Action Routing**:
   - High-priority emails trigger draft reply generation (Draft Reply node)
   - Urgent requests notify via Telegram
   - Categorized emails sorted into appropriate labels/folders
4. **Integration** (Partial Implementation):
   - Google Calendar integration (node present but not fully connected)
   - Telegram notifications for urgent items

## Services
- **Gmail** (Email processing)
- **Microsoft Azure OpenAI** (Natural Language Processing)
- **Google Calendar** (Scheduling - partially implemented)
- **Telegram** (Notifications)
- **JSON Schema** (Data structuring)
- **Email Classification System** (Custom logic for labels)

## Potential Issues
⚠️ **Missing Configurations**:
- Google Calendar node not connected in current workflow
- Multiple "sticky note" nodes with no operational purpose
- "No Operation" node present in workflow
- Unclear credential setup for Gmail/OpenAI nodes

**Recommendations for Improvement**:
1. Add credential validation for Gmail/OpenAI services
2. Complete Google Calendar integration for meeting scheduling
3. Remove non-functional "sticky note" placeholder nodes
4. Implement error handling for failed email processing
5. Add documentation for custom JSON schema usage in replies
