## n8n Workflow: Get All Tasks in Flow

This workflow retrieves all tasks from the Flow platform.

**Use cases:**

*   **Task Management Reporting:**  Generate a daily report of all tasks in Flow to track progress and identify bottlenecks.
*   **Data Backup:** Regularly extract all tasks from Flow and store them in a database or spreadsheet for backup and analysis.
*   **Cross-Platform Synchronization:**  Integrate Flow tasks with other project management tools or calendars.

**How it works:**

1.  The workflow is triggered manually using the "On clicking 'execute'" node.
2.  The "Flow" node then connects to the Flow API to retrieve all tasks.  The `operation` is set to `getAll` and `returnAll` is true to ensure all tasks are fetched.
3.  The output of the "Flow" node will be a list of all tasks from the Flow platform.

**Services:**

*   Flow (via the Flow API)
