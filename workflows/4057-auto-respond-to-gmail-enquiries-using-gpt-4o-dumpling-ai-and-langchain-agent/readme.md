# Auto-Respond to Gmail Enquiries using GPT-4o, Dumpling AI & LangChain Agent

## Use cases:

- **Automated Customer Support:** Automatically respond to customer inquiries received via Gmail, providing quick answers and reducing response times.
- **Lead Qualification:** Automatically identify and respond to sales inquiries, filtering out irrelevant emails and prioritizing potential leads.
- **Vacation Auto-Reply with Context:** Create an advanced "out of office" auto-reply that uses AI to understand the sender's question and provide helpful information or direct them to the right resources, even while you're away.

## How it works:

1.  **Watch for New Emails:** The workflow starts by monitoring a specified Gmail inbox for new incoming emails using the "Watch Gmail for New Incoming Emails" trigger node.
2.  **Classify Email Type:** The "Classify Email Type with GPT-4o" node uses the GPT-4o model to analyze the email content and determine if it is an enquiry. It returns "enquiry" if it is, and "false" if not.
3.  **Filter Enquiry Emails:** The "Only Proceed if Email is an Enquiry" node filters the emails, only allowing those classified as "enquiry" to proceed further in the workflow.
4.  **LangChain Agent for Reply Logic:** The "LangChain Agent Handles Reply Logic" node receives the email snippet from Gmail. It leverages a system message to act as a helpful assistant, using tools to search for user information and send email via the Gmail tool.
5. **Contextual information:** The Agent uses Dumpling AI to search for relevant information based on the email content.
6.  **Send Email Response:** Finally, the "Send Email Response via Gmail" node composes and sends an email back to the sender using the Gmail account. The message and subject are generated by an AI model using the $fromAI function, likely based on the information gathered and processed in the preceding steps.
