# Receive updates when a form is submitted in Wufoo

## Use cases:

- Get notified in real-time when someone submits a form on your Wufoo account.
- Trigger follow-up actions, such as sending a welcome email or updating a CRM, immediately after a Wufoo form submission.
- Create a log of all Wufoo form submissions in a separate system like Google Sheets or a database.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered by a new submission on a specified Wufoo form. The "Wufoo Trigger" node listens for new form entries. Once a submission is received, the workflow is activated.  Currently, this workflow only contains the trigger and does nothing with the received data.  To make it useful, you'd need to add subsequent nodes to process and utilize the form data.
