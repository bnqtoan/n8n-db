## n8n Workflow: Create a new task in Todoist

This workflow automates the creation of tasks in Todoist.

**Use cases:**

*   Quickly create a task in Todoist from n8n with a single click.
*   Can be integrated into more complex workflows that trigger task creation based on external events (e.g., new email, form submission).

**How it works:**

1.  The workflow is manually triggered by clicking the "Execute" button in n8n.
2.  The "Todoist" node then creates a new task in your Todoist account using the provided credentials.  The task content can be set in the Todoist node parameters.  Currently, the task content is empty, and needs to be configured in the node.

**Services:**

*   Todoist
