# NotionWebhookEmulator

## Use cases:

- **Real-time Task Synchronization:** Automatically sync tasks between a Notion database and an external application whenever a task is created or updated in Notion.
- **Data Backup and Auditing:** Create a backup of changes made to a Notion database in an external system (e.g., a database or log file) for auditing purposes.
- **Custom Notifications:** Trigger custom notifications in other platforms (e.g., Slack, email) based on specific changes in a Notion database.

## How it works:

1.  **Trigger**: The workflow starts with an "Execute Workflow Trigger" node, waiting for an external trigger.
2.  **Globals and Settings**: Retrieves global settings and existing settings from Supabase.
3.  **Get Modified Tasks**: Fetches modified tasks from a Notion database.
4.  **Looping**: It loops over each task retrieved from Notion.
5.  **Check for Existing Page**: Check if a page for the task already exists in the Supabase database.
6.  **Create or Update Page**: If the page doesn't exist, it creates a new page in Supabase; otherwise, it fetches the existing Notion page from Supabase.
7.  **Compare Data Sets**: Compares the data from Notion with the data stored in Supabase to detect changes.
8.  **Conditional Update**: If changes are detected, the workflow updates the Notion page in Supabase.
9.  **Aggregate**: Aggregates the data.
10. **Payload Push**: After processing all tasks, it pushes the aggregated data as a payload using an HTTP request.
