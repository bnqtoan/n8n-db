# Retell Voice Agent Custom Function Integration

## Use cases:

- **Dynamic Booking Confirmation:** A hotel booking agent confirms reservations and provides a confirmation message to the user using Retell's voice agent, triggered by a custom function in n8n.
- **CRM Integration:** Update customer records in a CRM system based on information gathered during a Retell voice agent conversation.
- **Personalized Responses:** Generate dynamic and personalized responses within a Retell voice agent based on real-time data fetched from external APIs or AI models.

## How it works:

1.  **Webhook Trigger:** The workflow starts with a "Webhook" node that listens for POST requests from Retell's Custom Function. This webhook is triggered when a Retell Voice Agent reaches a Custom Function node in its conversation flow.
2.  **Process data (Replace me! Set response):** This is the Placeholder to where the user can add any kind of logic to its workflow and process the input information.
3.  **Respond to Webhook:** The "[Replace me!] Set response" node (or replacement) sets a default confirmation message ("Your booking has been confirmed!"). This could be replaced with any custom logic and any type of interaction with 3rd party apps. The Response data is then sent back to Retell's Voice Agent, allowing it to respond to the user in real-time.
