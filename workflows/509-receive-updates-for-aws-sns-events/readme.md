## n8n Workflow: AWS SNS Trigger

This workflow is triggered by messages published to an AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic.

**Use cases:**

*   **Real-time event notifications:** Receive instant notifications when specific events occur within your AWS infrastructure or applications that publish messages to the designated SNS topic. For example, trigger actions based on database updates or server status changes.
*   **Asynchronous task processing:** Decouple application components by using SNS to queue tasks. This workflow can automatically initiate downstream processes when a new task is added to the queue.
*   **Monitoring and alerting:** Receive alerts for critical events, such as security breaches or system failures, by subscribing to relevant SNS topics.

**How it works:**

1.  The workflow is initiated by the "AWS-SNS-Trigger" node. This node continuously listens for messages published to the specified SNS topic (`arn:aws:sns:ap-south-1:100558637562:n8n-rocks`).
2.  When a message is published to the topic, the trigger node receives the message and passes it as input to subsequent nodes (currently none in the defined workflow). The message content can then be used to perform further actions within the n8n workflow.
