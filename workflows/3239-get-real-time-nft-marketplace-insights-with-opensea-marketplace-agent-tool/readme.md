# OpenSea Marketplace Agent Tool

## Use cases
1. **NFT Price Tracking** - Collectors and traders can automatically monitor the best listings and offers for specific NFTs or collections to identify favorable buying/selling opportunities.
2. **Market Analysis** - Analyze trending collections by retrieving active listings and offers across multiple blockchains to detect market patterns.
3. **Order Verification** - Validate specific NFT orders by fetching detailed information using order hashes, ensuring transaction authenticity before execution.

## How it works
The workflow uses AI-powered agents to process natural language queries about NFT marketplace data. Here's the sequence:
1. Users submit queries via the Workflow Input Trigger (e.g., "Find lowest-priced Bored Ape listings")
2. The GPT-4o Mini model interprets requests and selects appropriate tools
3. Connects to OpenSea API through 12 specialized endpoints including:
   - Collection-wide listings/offers
   - NFT-specific pricing data
   - Blockchain-filtered orders
   - Trait-based offers
4. Maintains conversation context using a memory buffer
5. Returns structured API data through the agent for analysis or integration
