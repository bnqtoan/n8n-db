# SmartLead Sheet Sync: Auto-Capture Client Inquiries to Google Sheets

## Use cases

*   **Automated Lead Capture:** Automatically capture leads from a form submission and save them to a Google Sheet for easy tracking and management.
*   **Simplified Data Entry:** Eliminate manual data entry by automatically parsing and cleaning lead data before storing it in Google Sheets.
*   **Real-time Lead Tracking:** Keep your lead data up-to-date in real-time as soon as a form is submitted, ensuring timely follow-up and improved conversion rates.

## How it works

1.  **Form Submission Hook:** The workflow starts when a form is submitted, triggering a webhook. This is handled by the "Form Submission Hook" node, which listens for incoming data.
2.  **Parse + Clean Lead Data:** The "Parse + Clean Lead Data" node receives the data from the webhook. This node contains code to parse the data from the form submission and prepare it for storage, which may include cleaning or formatting.
3.  **Save To Google Sheets:** The "Save To Google Sheets" node takes the parsed and cleaned data and appends it to a specified Google Sheet. This node handles the authentication and data transfer to Google Sheets.
