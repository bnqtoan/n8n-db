2.  **AI Agent:** The AI Agent orchestrates the content creation process.
3.  **Fetch HN Front Page/Article:** Fetches trending news from Hacker News front page or a specific article using the Hacker News Tool.
4.  **Write Script:** Langchain is used to write a script based on the fetched news, which is passed back to the AI Agent.

6.  **Setup Heygen:** Sets up necessary parameters for Heygen, an AI video generation platform.
7.  **Create Avatar Video:** An HTTP Request node sends the script to Heygen (or similar service) to create an AI avatar video.

9.  **Get Avatar Video:**  The workflow retrieves the generated video from Heygen.
10. **Prepare for Publish:** The node prepares the video and captions for publishing.
11. **Upload to Blotato:** The workflow uploads the video to Blotato, a platform presumably used for social media management.
