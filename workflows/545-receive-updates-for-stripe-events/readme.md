# Stripe Trigger Workflow

## Use cases:

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Immediately react to any event within your Stripe account, enabling instant notifications or automated actions.
*   **Data Synchronization:** Automatically update external databases or systems when changes occur in your Stripe data (e.g., new customers, payment updates).
*   **Custom Reporting:** Trigger the generation of customized reports based on specific Stripe events, providing timely insights into your business performance.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered by events happening in your Stripe account.

1.  **Stripe Trigger:** The workflow starts with the "Stripe Trigger" node.  This node listens for any event (`"*"`) occurring in your Stripe account via a webhook. When an event happens (e.g., a new customer is created, a payment is received), the workflow is initiated.
    The workflow does not have any subsequent nodes, so it only receives the event from Stripe.
