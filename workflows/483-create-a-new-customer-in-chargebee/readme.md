## n8n Workflow: Create a new customer in Chargebee

This workflow automates the creation of new customer profiles within Chargebee.

**Use cases:**

*   **Manual Customer Entry:** Quickly create new Chargebee customer records directly from n8n using the "Execute Workflow" button. This is useful for one-off customer creations or when other systems are not directly integrated.
*   **Testing and Development:** Streamline the process of setting up test customer accounts in Chargebee during development and testing phases.
*   **Simple Customer Onboarding:** Create customers in Chargebee based on information collected manually or through a basic form.

**How it works:**

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow is initiated manually using the "On clicking 'execute'" node. This provides a direct and immediate way to trigger the workflow.
2.  **Create Customer in Chargebee:** The "Chargebee" node then creates a new customer record in your Chargebee account. It takes the first name and last name to create a customer.
