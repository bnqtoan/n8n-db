# My Workflow

## Use cases:
- Setting a default value for a field in a system, even when no data is available yet. This ensures that the field always has a value.
- Transforming data structures by assigning a default value before performing more complex operations.
- Predefining configurations for API calls or other integrations, ensuring consistent behavior.

## How it works:
1.  The workflow is manually triggered by clicking the "execute" button in n8n.
2.  The "Set" node creates a field called `key` and assigns it the value `somevalue`.
3.  The "Rename Keys" node rename `key` to `newkey`.
