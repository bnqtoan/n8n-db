# Auth0 User Login

## Use cases:

- **Secure User Authentication for Web Applications:** Implement a secure login system for your web application using Auth0. This workflow handles the user authentication process, retrieves access tokens, and fetches user information, ensuring only authorized users can access your application.
- **Streamlined User Onboarding:** Automate the user onboarding process by leveraging Auth0's authentication capabilities. When a new user signs up, this workflow can automatically retrieve user details and trigger subsequent actions, such as adding the user to a database or sending a welcome email.
- **API Access Control:** Secure your APIs by integrating this workflow with your API gateway. The workflow verifies user credentials using Auth0 and provides access tokens that can be used to authenticate API requests, protecting your APIs from unauthorized access.

## How it works:

1.  **/login Webhook:** The workflow starts with a webhook node (`/login`) that listens for incoming login requests. When a user accesses the login URL, the workflow triggers.
2.  **Set Application Details:** The `Set Application Details` node stores the Auth0 domain, client ID, and the n8n server URL.
3.  **Open Auth Webpage:** The `Open Auth Webpage` node redirects the user to the Auth0 authorization page. This page prompts the user to log in using their Auth0 credentials (e.g., username/password, Google, Facebook).
4.  **/receive-token Webhook:** After successful authentication, Auth0 redirects the user back to the n8n workflow via the `/receive-token` webhook, including an authorization code in the query parameters.
5.  **If:** The `If` node checks if the authorization code is present in the query parameters. If the code is missing, the workflow stops and returns an error (`No Code Found`).
6.  **Set Application Details1:** The `Set Application Details1` node stores the Auth0 domain, client ID, client secret, and the n8n server URL.
7.  **Request Access Token:** The `Request Access Token` node exchanges the authorization code for an access token by making a POST request to the Auth0 `/oauth/token` endpoint.
8.  **Get Userinfo:** The `Get Userinfo` node uses the access token to retrieve user information from the Auth0 `/userinfo` endpoint.
