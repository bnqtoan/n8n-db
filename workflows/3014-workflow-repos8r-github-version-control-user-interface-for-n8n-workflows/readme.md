# Dynamic GitHub Workflows

## Use Cases:

- **Automated Workflow Updates:**  Automatically update n8n workflows stored in a GitHub repository based on changes made via a web form or API call.  This allows for version control and collaborative editing of workflows.
- **Workflow Promotion between Environments:**  Promote workflows from a development environment to a production environment by triggering the workflow via webhook and committing the changes to a specific branch in GitHub.
- **Dynamic UI Generation for Workflow Management:** Create a dynamic UI to manage workflows and their parameters, updating the corresponding workflows in a GitHub repository.

## How it Works:

This workflow enables dynamic management of n8n workflows stored in a GitHub repository. It uses webhooks to trigger actions based on user input, such as form submissions or API calls. The workflow functions as follows:

1.  **Webhook Triggers:** The workflow starts with multiple webhook nodes ("Webhook-ideogener8r", "submit-form", "Get-n8n-workflows", "Get-Workflow-Changes"). These webhooks listen for incoming requests, which can be triggered by user actions or external systems.
2.  **Fetch and Set Workflow variables:** The Set node "Set Workflow Variables" save input data to be used later on, after receiving input through the webhook
3.  **GitHub interaction:** The GitHub node commits the data into the repository
4.  **Set Flows:** Save the Github data into the Set Flows Node
5.  **Respond to Webhooks:** Finally send back the data to the webhook that called it.

## Services:

-   GitHub: For storing and version controlling n8n workflow files.
-   n8n: (used twice as nodes) To fetch and update n8n workflows via its API.
