# LinkedIn Lead Processing and CRM Update Workflow

## Use Cases  
1. **Automated LinkedIn Lead Processing**: Capture LinkedIn profile data via webhooks and process it to determine user relationships.  
2. **CRM Integration**: Update Google Sheets with lead status (e.g., "invited" or "contacted") based on LinkedIn interactions.  
3. **Conditional Notifications**: Trigger follow-up actions (e.g., sending messages or alerts) when specific criteria are met (e.g., a user is not a connection).  

## How It Works  
1. **Webhook Trigger**: The workflow starts with a webhook (e.g., from LinkedIn) that captures user data.  
2. **Data Extraction**: Extracts LinkedIn profile information (e.g., username, connection status) from incoming data.  
3. **Condition Checks**: Uses `If` nodes to verify conditions (e.g., `is_relationship` flag) to determine if the user is a LinkedIn connection.  
4. **Google Sheets Integration**:  
   - **Read/Write Data**: Fetches or updates lead status in Google Sheets (e.g., "invited" or "contacted").  
   - **CRM Sync**: Updates the CRM with new lead data or status changes.  
5. **Action Triggers**:  
   - Sends a contact request or notification if the user is not a connection.  
   - Triggers a follow-up workflow (e.g., sending an automated "icebreaker" message).  

## Services  
- **LinkedIn** (via HTTP requests for profile data).  
- **Google Sheets** (CRM and data storage).  
- **Webhooks** (triggering workflows and receiving data).

**Note**: The workflow includes placeholder nodes (e.g., "Sticky Notes") and conditional branches that may require customization. Ensure Google Sheets API and LinkedIn webhook configurations are properly set up for full functionality.
