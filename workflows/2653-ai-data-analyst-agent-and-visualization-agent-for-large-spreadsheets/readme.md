# Data Analyst Agent v3

## Use Cases

*   **Data Analysis via Chat Interface:** Users can ask questions or request analysis of data stored in a NocoDB database through a chat interface. The agent processes the request, interacts with the database, and provides a response based on the data analysis.
*   **Automated Reporting:** This workflow can be used to automate the generation of reports based on specific queries or criteria. Users can define the questions or analysis they need regularly, and the agent will fetch the data and provide the results in a structured format.
*   **Real-time Data Insights:** The agent can provide real-time insights from the database by continuously monitoring the data and alerting users when certain conditions are met or when specific patterns are detected.

## How it Works

1.  **Chat Trigger:** The workflow starts with a "Chat Trigger" node, which listens for incoming chat messages (likely via a webhook).
2.  **Settings:** A "Settings" node likely configures parameters needed for subsequent nodes. This could include API keys, database credentials, or other configurations.
3.  **NocoDB Data Extraction:** The "nocodb_extract_table" node uses an HTTP Request to presumably get data from a NocoDB database. The URL and necessary parameters for accessing the NocoDB API are configured in this node.
4.  **Column Extraction:** The "Extract\_Columns" node parses the JSON data received from NocoDB and extracts the specific columns needed for analysis.
5.  **Data Analyst Agent:** The "Data Analyst Agent" node is the core of the workflow. It leverages the Langchain Agent. The agent receives the user's question, the extracted data, and is connected to a Language Model and memory. It uses the OpenAI Chat Model, NocoDB tool, and Window Buffer Memory. The agent then analyzes the data based on the question and generates a response.
6.  **OpenAI Chat Model:** This uses OpenAI's chat models to process and understand the data.
7.  **Window Buffer Memory:** To make the agent more intelligent it uses short term memory of the chat history.
8.  **NocoDB Tool:** This allows the agent to connect with the NocoDB database to retrieve information.
