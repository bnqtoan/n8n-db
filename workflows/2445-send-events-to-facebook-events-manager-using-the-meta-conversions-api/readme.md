# My Workflow

## Use cases:

- **Data Processing and Event Triggering:** This workflow can be used to process data, encrypt it for security, and then send it as an event to Meta (likely Facebook).
- **Testing Data Pipelines:** Useful for testing data transformations and event-sending logic before deploying a full-scale data pipeline.
- **Privacy-Sensitive Data Handling:** In scenarios where user data needs to be processed and sent to a third-party platform (Meta), this workflow can help ensure data is normalized and encrypted to comply with privacy regulations.

## How it works:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow starts when you manually click "Test workflow" in n8n.
2.  **Example Data:** The "Example data" node (Code node) likely contains a script that generates or provides a sample dataset that will be used for test the flow.
3.  **Normalize Data:** The "Normalize data" node (Set node) applies data transformation rules to the input data, standardizing it for further processing (e.g., standardizing date formats, handling missing values).
4.  **Encrypt Data:** The "Encrypt data" node (Set node) encrypts the normalized data, protecting sensitive information during transmission.
5.  **Send event to Meta:** The "Send event to Meta" node (Facebook Graph API node) sends the encrypted data to Facebook/Meta as an event. This could be for advertising, analytics, or other purposes.
