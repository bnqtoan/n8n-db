## Pipedrive Deal Creation Workflow

This workflow automates the creation of deals in Pipedrive.

### Use cases:

*   **Quick Deal Creation:**  Sales representatives can instantly create a new deal in Pipedrive with a single click within n8n. This eliminates manual data entry and saves time.
*   **Testing Pipedrive Integration:** Developers can easily test their Pipedrive integration and configurations within n8n.

### How it works:

1.  The workflow is initiated manually using the "On clicking 'execute'" trigger node.
2.  The "Pipedrive" node then creates a new deal in your Pipedrive account. The title and additional fields can be configured in the Pipedrive node's parameters.  *Note:*  As configured, it will create a deal with default settings as title and additional fields are empty.  Credentials for Pipedrive are required to authenticate the node.
