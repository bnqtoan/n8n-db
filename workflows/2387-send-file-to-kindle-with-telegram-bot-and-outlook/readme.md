# Send File to Kindle Through Telegram Bot

## Use cases:

*   **Send ebooks to your Kindle:** You can easily forward ebook files (e.g., .mobi, .pdf) from Telegram to your Kindle device for reading.
*   **Archive documents on Kindle:** Quickly save important documents or articles shared on Telegram to your Kindle for offline access.
*   **Share files with family:** Allow family members to share files directly to a registered kindle email address without directly accessing the kindle account.

## How it works:

1.  **Receive Telegram Message:** The workflow starts when a message is received by a Telegram bot (`receive file message from telegram bot`). It's configured to trigger only on messages containing files.
2.  **Check for File:** An "IF" node (`check if there is a file in the message`) verifies if the received message includes a file attachment.
3.  **Handle Missing File:** If no file is found, the workflow sends a warning message back to the Telegram chat (`reply to warn that file is missing`) to prompt the user to check their message.
4.  **Rename File:** For a proper email format, the file name gets renamed to the email attachments format (`rename file to as attachment out email`).
5.  **Send Email to Kindle:** If a file is attached, the workflow sends an email (`send email with the file as attchament to kindle`) containing the file as an attachment to the specified Kindle email address. The email body includes the file name.
6.  **Confirmation Message:** After the email is successfully sent, a confirmation message (`reply to telegram chat that the file has been sent successfully`) is sent back to the Telegram chat, notifying the user that the file has been sent to their Kindle.

## Services:

*   **Telegram:** Used for receiving file messages via a Telegram bot.
*   **Microsoft Outlook:** Used for sending the file as an email attachment to a Kindle email address.
*   **Amazon Kindle:** Used as the final destination for the ebook or document
