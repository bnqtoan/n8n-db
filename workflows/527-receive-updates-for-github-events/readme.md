# Github Repository Watcher

## Use cases:

-   **Real-time Notifications:** Instantly notify a team channel (e.g., Slack or Discord) whenever a change is made to a specified GitHub repository.
-   **Automated Documentation Updates:** Trigger automatic documentation updates or rebuilds whenever content is pushed to a documentation repository, ensuring that documentation is always up-to-date.

## How it works:

This workflow uses the "Github Trigger" node to monitor a specific GitHub repository for any events. The node is configured to listen for all events (`"*"`) within the "n8n-docs" repository owned by "n8n-io".  Whenever an event occurs (e.g., a push, a new issue, a pull request), the workflow will be triggered.
