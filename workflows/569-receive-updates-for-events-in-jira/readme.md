# Jira Trigger Workflow

## Use cases:

- **Real-time Notifications:** Send instant notifications to a communication channel (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) whenever a Jira issue is updated. This helps teams stay informed about critical changes and react promptly.
- **Automated Backups:** Trigger a backup of Jira issue data to a database or storage service whenever an issue is created, updated, or deleted. This ensures data integrity and facilitates disaster recovery.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Initiate downstream processes in other systems (e.g., triggering a build in Jenkins, creating a task in a project management tool) based on Jira issue events. This enables seamless integration between Jira and other tools in the development pipeline.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered by events within Jira.

1.  **Jira Trigger:** The workflow starts with the "Jira Trigger" node. This node listens for all events happening in Jira related to issues. When an event occurs (like a new issue being created, an issue being updated, or an issue being resolved), the workflow is activated.
