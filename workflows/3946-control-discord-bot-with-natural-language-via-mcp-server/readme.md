# Discord MCP Server

## Use cases:

- **Automated Discord Server Management:** This workflow can be used to automate tasks like assigning roles to new members, removing roles based on specific criteria, and sending welcome messages or announcements to specific channels or users via DMs.
- **Interactive Discord Bot for User Support:** It can create an interactive bot that responds to user requests, gathers information through direct messages, and performs actions like adding or removing roles based on user input.
- **Moderation Automation:** The workflow allows for basic moderation tasks, such as removing roles from misbehaving users or sending warnings via DMs. Combined with monitoring triggers, this could lead to automating actions based on detected spam or abuse.

## How it works:

1.  **Discord MCP Server Trigger:** The workflow is initiated by a trigger, presumably a Message Content Protocol (MCP) trigger, which means an AI determines the correct node to use and triggers that node, based on the request.
2.  **Get Discord Server IDs:** Retrieves the IDs of all Discord servers the bot is in via a custom HTTP Request node.
3. **Get Members of Server by Server ID/ Get Channels of server by server ID:** Retrieves all members and channels for the specified server.
4.  **Send DM to User/ Send Discord Message to Channel/ Send DM and Wait for reply/ Send to Channel and Wait for Reply:** Sends messages to users via DM or sends messages to a channel on the discord server. Waits for a response from the user.
5.  **Add Role To Member/ Remove Role from member:** Adds/Removes roles from members of the discord server.
