# Automated Image Metadata Tagging (Community Node)

## Use cases:

- **Automated Image Organization:** Automatically tag images uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder with relevant metadata based on their content, making them easily searchable and organized.
- **Content Enrichment for Digital Assets:** Enhance digital asset libraries by automatically adding descriptive keywords to images, improving their discoverability and SEO value.
- **Streamlined Media Workflows:** Simplify workflows for photographers, designers, and marketers by automatically tagging images as they are added to a shared drive, saving time and improving collaboration.

## How it works:

1.  **Google Drive Trigger:** The workflow starts when a new file is added to a specific Google Drive folder (named "EXIF" based on the config).
2.  **Download Image File:** The newly added image file is downloaded from Google Drive.
3.  **Analyze Image Content:** The image is sent to an AI model (ChatGPT-4o-latest) to analyze its content and generate a comma-separated list of descriptive keywords.
4.  **Merge Metadata and Image File:** Combines the original image file with the metadata generated by AI.
5.  **Write Metadata into Image:** The AI-generated keywords are written into the image's metadata as "Subject" and "Keywords" using the "n8n-nodes-exif-data" community node.
6.  **Update Image File:** The original image file in Google Drive is updated with the new metadata.
