# Classify_Emails_by_Action_Required_Using_GPT-4o

## Use cases:

- **Automated Email Triage:** Automatically sorts incoming emails into "Action Required" and "No Action" categories, helping users prioritize their responses and manage their inbox more efficiently.
- **Focus on Important Tasks:** By filtering out informational emails, users can quickly identify and address tasks that require immediate attention, improving productivity and reducing the risk of overlooking critical requests.
- **Email Archiving and Organization:** Automatically labels and archives emails based on their actionability, creating a well-organized email archive for future reference and compliance purposes.

## How it works:

This workflow automates the process of classifying emails in your Gmail inbox based on whether they require action. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1.  **Schedule Trigger:** The workflow is triggered on a set interval (defined in the node configuration).
2.  **Get Emails:** This node fetches all unread emails from your specified Gmail inbox.
3.  **Email Classifier:**  For each email, the node takes the email snippet and uses a text classifier powered by GPT-4o to determine if the email requires an action or not, based on pre-defined categories and descriptions.
4.  **Add "Action Required" Label / Add "No Action" Label:** Based on the classification, the workflow adds either the "Action Required" or "No Action" label to the email within Gmail.
5.  **Remove "Inbox" Label:** After adding the appropriate label, the workflow removes the "Inbox" label from the email, effectively archiving it from the main inbox view.
