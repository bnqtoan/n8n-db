## Receive updates for events in Chargebee Workflow

### Use cases:

*   **Real-time Notifications:** Get notified immediately about any changes or events in your Chargebee account, such as new subscriptions, failed payments, or updated customer information.
*   **Automated Data Synchronization:** Automatically update records in other systems (e.g., CRM, databases) whenever a relevant event occurs in Chargebee, ensuring data consistency across platforms.
*   **Custom Reporting:** Trigger custom reports or dashboards based on specific Chargebee events, allowing for timely analysis and decision-making.

### How it works:

This workflow is triggered by events happening in your Chargebee account.

1.  **Chargebee Trigger:** The workflow starts with the "Chargebee Trigger" node. This node listens for events in your Chargebee account. The current configuration is set to listen for *all* events (`"*"`). When an event occurs, the workflow is initiated, and the event data is passed to subsequent nodes (if any were present).
