# WP - Updated

## Use Cases:

- **Automated Content Creation for WordPress:** Automatically generate blog posts for a WordPress website based on scheduled triggers or Telegram commands, including title generation, content creation, image generation, and posting to WordPress as a draft with a featured image.
- **Content Repurposing and Distribution:** Create content and automatically post the content to Wordpress, then disseminate updates on new posts to a Discord channel and a Telegram chat, enhancing content reach.
- **Hands-Free Content Pipeline:** Schedule content to be created using an LLM, generate a featured image using the OpenAI image API, and upload and publish the content to WordPress without manual intervention, saving time and effort.

## How it Works:

This workflow automates WordPress blog post creation using n8n and several services.

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow starts either on a schedule (`Schedule Trigger`) or via a Telegram command (`Telegram Trigger`). A conditional node (`If`) directs the flow depending on which trigger was activated.
2.  **Topic and Title Generation:** An LLM (Language Model) chain (`Topic Chooser and Title Maker`, `Title, category, meta, keyphrase generator`) generates a topic and title.
3.  **Article Generation:** Based on the generated title, an LLM (`Article Generator`) generates the article content. The article is then passed to another LLM chain (`Basic LLM Chain`).
4.  **WordPress Post Creation:** The generated content is then used to create a draft post in WordPress (`Wordpress Post Draft`).
5.  **Image Generation:**  OpenAI's image generation API (`OpenAI - Generate Image`) creates an image for the post.
6.  **Image Upload and Featured Image Setting:** The generated image is uploaded to WordPress (`Upload Image to WP`), and set as the featured image for the created post (`Wordpress - Set Featured Image`).
7.  **Notifications:** Finally, notifications about the new post are sent to a Discord channel (`Send to Discord Using Webhook`) and a Telegram chat (`Telegram`).

## Services:

-   **WordPress:** The workflow directly creates and updates posts on a WordPress site.
-   **OpenAI:** Used for generating both the article content and the featured image.
-   **Discord:** Sends notifications about newly created posts to a Discord channel.
-   **Telegram:** Starts the workflow through Telegram commands and sends notifications about new posts.
