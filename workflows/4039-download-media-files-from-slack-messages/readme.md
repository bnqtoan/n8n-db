# Slack File Downloader Workflow

## Use cases:

- **Automatic Backup of Slack Files:** Automatically download files shared in Slack channels to a secure storage location for backup purposes.
- **Content Archiving:** Archive important documents, images, or other files shared in Slack for compliance or knowledge management.
- **Custom File Processing:** Trigger automated processes (e.g., virus scanning, OCR, or resizing) when a file is shared in Slack.

## How it works:

1.  **Trigger Slack File Message:** The workflow starts when a new message containing a file is posted in a Slack channel that the connected Slack app is authorized to monitor.
2.  **Download Media from Slack:** The workflow extracts the private download URL of the file from the Slack message and uses an HTTP Request node to download the file content. This node uses HTTP Header Authentication to authenticate with Slack.
