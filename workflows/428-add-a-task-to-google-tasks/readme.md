## Use Cases

*   **Quick Task Creation:**  Easily add tasks to your Google Tasks list directly from the n8n interface without needing to manually open the Google Tasks application.
*   **Triggered Task Creation:**  Use the "Execute" button as a simple trigger for creating tasks during demonstrations or when you need a manual task creation option as part of a larger workflow (e.g., after a meeting).

## How it Works

This workflow is triggered manually using the "On clicking 'execute'" node. Upon execution, it directly creates a task within your Google Tasks list using the "Google Tasks" node.  The "Google Tasks" node is configured to create a task, connecting to your Google Tasks account via OAuth2 authentication. The task is being added to the default task list ID.
