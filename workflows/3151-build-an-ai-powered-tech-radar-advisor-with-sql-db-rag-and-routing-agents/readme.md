# Tech Radar

## Use cases:

- **Technology Adoption Advisory:** Provides internal employees with advice on technology adoption, ensuring alignment with the company's strategic direction across different child companies.
- **Tech Radar Database Management:** Automates the periodic synchronization of technology radar data from a Google Sheet into a MySQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
- **AI-Powered Tech Radar Chatbot:** Enables employees to ask questions about the technology landscape and receive answers powered by either a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent or a SQL agent, depending on the nature of the query.

## How it works:

This workflow automates the process of maintaining a technology radar, making it accessible through an AI-powered chatbot. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Data Source (Google Sheets):** Reads technology data from a Google Sheet ("Tech Constellation Compass"), which includes details like technology name, ring (Adopt, Assess, Hold, Trial), quadrant, strategic direction, usage by child companies, and a description.
2. **Data Transformation & Storage:**
   - Transforms the Google Sheets data into a structured format suitable for both document-style RAG and structured SQL querying.
   - Stores the transformed data into two places:
     - **Google Docs:** Transform the google sheet into a google docs paragraph format.
     - **MySQL Database:** Synchronizes the Google Sheet data to a MySQL database table (techradar). A Cron node triggers a periodic deletion and re-insertion of the data to keep it up-to-date.
3. **Vector Database Updates (RAG):**
   - A Google Drive Trigger monitors a specific folder ("TechConstellationGenerated") for updates to Google Doc files.
   - When a file is updated:
     - It downloads the Google Doc file.
     - Loads the document data using the "Doc File Data Loader" node.
     - Splits the text into chunks with "Recursive Character Text Splitter".
     - Generates embeddings for each chunk using "Embeddings - Tech Radar Data Embedding" node using Gemini.
     - Inserts these embeddings into a Pinecone vector store ("techradardata").
4. **Chat Interface (Webhook):**
   - An API Request - Webhook node creates an endpoint ("radar-rag") that listens for user questions.
   - The "LLM - Determine - Agent Input Router" node, using a language model, determines whether the question is best answered using the RAG agent (vector database) or the SQL agent (MySQL database).
   - Based on the determination, one of two "Execute Workflow" nodes is triggered:
     - **RAG Agent:** Executes a sub-workflow ("TechRadar-Subworkflow2") designed to query the Pinecone vector store and formulate a response.
     - **SQL Agent:** Executes a sub-workflow ("TechRadar-Subworkflow1-DB") designed to query the MySQL database and formulate a response.
5. **Output Guardrail:**
   - Passes the answer generated by the AI agent into output guardrail.
6. **Response:** The "API Response - Respond to Webhook" node sends the final answer back to the user through the webhook.
