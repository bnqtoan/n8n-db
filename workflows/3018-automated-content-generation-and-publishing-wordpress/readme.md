# Automated Content Generation & Publishing - Wordpress

## Use cases:

- **Automated Blog Posting:** Automatically generate and publish blog posts to a WordPress site on a predefined schedule. This is useful for maintaining a consistent flow of content without manual intervention.
- **Content Marketing Campaign:** Create and schedule multiple articles around specific keywords to boost SEO and drive traffic to a website. The randomized delays mimic human-like posting behavior.
- **Curated Content Creation:** Generate content outlines using AI, populate them with relevant information, and publish them as articles. This allows for quick creation of informative posts on trending topics.

## How it works:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow starts based on a schedule (`3. Schedule Your Posts`).
2.  **Processing Delay:** A random delay (0-6 hours) is introduced to simulate a more natural posting pattern (`Processing Delay`, `Random Wait`).
3.  **AI Content Generation:** An AI model (GPT-4o using the OpenAI node) generates a complete article, including a title, content in HTML format, and image search keywords based on a prompt (`Generate AI Content`).
4.  **Save to Google Sheets:** The generated title, content, and keywords are saved to a Google Sheet (`Save to Sheet`). This can act as a backup or a content repository.
5.  **Image Retrieval:** The workflow searches for a relevant image on Pexels using the generated keywords (`Automated Image Retrieval from Pexels`).
6.  **WordPress Post Creation:** Finally, a post is created on a WordPress site, using the generated title and content. The image from Pexels is embedded at the beginning of the post (`Create posts on Wordpress`). The post is set to "publish" status.

## Services:

-   **OpenAI:** Used for AI-powered content generation (GPT-4o).
-   **Google Sheets:** Used for storing and managing generated content.
-   **Pexels:** Used for fetching images to include in the WordPress posts.
-   **WordPress:** The target platform for publishing the generated content.
