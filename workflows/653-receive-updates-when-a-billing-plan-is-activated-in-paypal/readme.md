# Receive updates when a billing plan is activated in PayPal

## Use cases:

*   **Real-time Notifications:** Get instantly notified via other services (like Slack or email) when a billing plan is activated in PayPal, allowing for immediate action or monitoring.
*   **Automated Database Updates:** Automatically update a database or spreadsheet with details of newly activated billing plans for tracking and reporting purposes.
*   **Trigger Follow-up Actions:** Initiate automated follow-up actions, such as sending welcome emails to customers, when their billing plan becomes active.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered by the `PayPal Trigger` node. When a billing plan is activated in PayPal, PayPal sends a webhook notification to n8n. The `PayPal Trigger` node, configured to listen for the `BILLING.PLAN.ACTIVATED` event, receives this notification.  Currently, this workflow only receives the trigger. To make it functional, you'd need to add subsequent nodes to process the data received from PayPal and perform actions such as sending a notification or updating a database.
