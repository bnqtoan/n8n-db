# ðŸ“„âœ¨ Easy Wordpress Content Creation from PDF Document + Human In The Loop with Gmail Approval

## Use cases:

1.  **Automated Blog Content Creation:** Streamline the process of generating blog posts from PDF documents, saving time and resources for content creators.
2.  **Content Repurposing:** Easily convert existing PDF reports, whitepapers, or ebooks into blog articles to expand the reach of valuable information.
3.  **Quality-Controlled Content Generation:** Implement a human-in-the-loop approval process to ensure the accuracy and quality of AI-generated content before publishing.

## How it works:

1.  **PDF Upload:** The workflow starts when a user uploads a PDF file through a web form (`Upload PDF` node).
2.  **Text Extraction:** The text is extracted from the PDF file (`Extract Text` node).
3.  **AI-Powered Blog Post Generation:** the extracted text is sent to `gpt-4o-mini` node using `Write Blog Post` node, which utilizes an AI model to generate a blog post with an SEO-friendly title and well-formatted HTML content.
4.  **Title and Content Extraction**: Extract the title and content of the blog post using regex (`Get Blog Post` node).
5.  **Content Approval:** An email containing the generated content is sent to a designated reviewer via Gmail for approval (`Human In The Loop Approve Blog Post` node). The workflow pauses until a response is received.
6.  **Conditional Branching:** The workflow checks if the content is approved (`Is Approved?` node).
    *   If approved, it proceeds to create a WordPress post.
    *   If not approved, a Telegram message is sent to notify of the error (`Send Error Message` node).
7.  **Image Generation:** `pollinations.ai` generates an image based on the blog post title.
8.  **Image Upload to WordPress:** Upload the image to WordPress (`Upload Image to Wordpress` node).
9.  **Set Featured Image:** Set the uploaded image as the featured image for the WordPress post (`Set Image on Wordpress Post` node).
10. **Save Image to imgbb.com:** Upload the generated image to `imgbb.com` for permanent storage.
11. **Create WordPress Post:** A draft post is created in WordPress with the generated title and content (`Create Wordpress Post` node).
12.  **Notifications:** Upon successful post creation and image update, notifications are sent via Gmail and Telegram (`Gmail Final Blog` and `Telegram Partial Blog` nodes).
