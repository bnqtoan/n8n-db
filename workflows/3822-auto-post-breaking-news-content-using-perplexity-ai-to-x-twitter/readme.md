# Search news using Perplexity AI and post to X (Twitter)

## Use cases:

- Automatically share trending AI news on a Twitter/X account to engage followers.
- Curate and post news headlines at regular intervals without manual intervention.
- Generate content for a news aggregator or social media feed focused on AI.

## How it works:

1.  **Schedule Trigger:** The workflow starts with a Schedule Trigger that runs every 21 hours with a random minute.
2.  **searchQuery:** Sets the search query to "What's the latest news in artificial intelligence?".
3.  **set API key:** Sets the Perplexity API key. Replace `<yourPerplexityAPI>` with your actual API key.
4.  **Perplexity:** Sends a request to the Perplexity AI API to get a summarized tech news article. It formats the request to return a headline (max 140 characters) and a link, keeping the total output under 200 characters.
5.  **Post to X:** Takes the content generated by Perplexity AI and posts it to a connected X (Twitter) account.
