## n8n Workflow: Receive Updates for Specified Tasks in Flow

This workflow is designed to monitor and receive updates for specific tasks within the Flow platform.

**Use cases:**

*   **Task Progress Tracking:** Automatically receive notifications whenever the status of a monitored task changes in Flow.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Keep stakeholders informed about the progress of critical tasks without manual checking.
*   **Automated Reporting:** Trigger downstream workflows to generate reports or update dashboards based on task updates.

**How it works:**

1.  The workflow starts with the "Flow Trigger" node.
2.  This node is configured to listen for changes to tasks within the Flow platform (specified via the `resource` parameter).
3.  The `taskIds` parameter allows you to specify the specific tasks to monitor.  *Note: The current workflow does not specify task IDs and is therefore monitoring all tasks, which might not be desired in a production environment.*
4.  Whenever an update occurs on the specified tasks, the workflow is triggered.
5.  *Note: The current workflow only contains the trigger and performs no action upon trigger. Further nodes must be added to define the action taken when an update is received.*

**Services:**

*   Flow (Assuming "Flow" refers to a specific task management or project management platform with an API.)
