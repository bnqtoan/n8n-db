# Find the Content Gaps in Your Competitors' Discourse for Market Research and SEO

## Use cases:

- **Competitive Analysis:** Identify content gaps in competitors' websites to inform content strategy and gain a competitive edge.
- **SEO Optimization:** Discover relevant topics and keywords that competitors are not covering to improve search engine rankings.
- **Market Research:** Analyze the discourse of multiple companies in a specific market to understand trends, identify unmet needs, and inform product development.

## How it works:

This workflow automates the process of extracting content from websites, analyzing it using AI, and identifying content gaps. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Data Input:**
    *   **Option A (Stage 1: Data Enrichment):** Takes a Google Sheet containing a list of company names and URLs, it could be manually created or generated using the "Generate a List of URLs to Analyze" sub-workflow. It uses the "Read a Google Sheets File" node to read the specified google sheet.
    *   **Option B (Stage 2: Insight Generation):** Takes a Google Sheet containing the "Topical Summary" column, enriching the data to add more insight into each company's content.
2.  **Batch Processing:** Splits the URLs into batches (default: 10) to avoid rate limiting issues using the "Split In Batches" node.
3.  **Content Extraction:**
    *   The "HTTP Request" node fetches the HTML content from each URL.
    *   The "HTML Extract" node extracts the body text from the HTML.
    *   The "Clean Content" node cleans the extracted text by removing HTML tags, extra spaces, and line breaks.
4.  **AI-Powered Analysis (Stage 1: Data Enrichment):**
    *   "InfraNodus GraphRAG Content Enhancer" sends the extracted text to the InfraNodus API to generate topical summaries and identify content gaps (graph summary).
5.  **Data Enrichment:**
    *   The "Merge" node combines the original data (company name, URL) with the AI-generated summaries.
    *   The "Update Google Sheets with Content Insights" node updates the original Google Sheet with the topical summaries and graph summaries.
6.  **Rate Limiting:** The "Wait to avoid API overload" node pauses execution to avoid rate limiting issues.
7.  **Looping:** The "If Node: did we process all the data?" node checks if all URLs have been processed. If not, it loops back to step 2.
8.  **Insight Generation (Stage 2: Insight Generation):**
    *   The "Get the content from Google Sheets" node fetches data from a Google sheet with the Topical Summary column.
    *   The "Aggregate" node merges the fetched Topical and Graph summaries into one so that they can be processed as a single unit.
    *   The "InfraNodus AI Advice" and "InfraNodus Question Generator" nodes use the Topical Summary to identify the main topics and gaps in the discourse and to formulate questions.
9.  **Report Generation:**
    *   The "Merge1" node merges the insights generated by the AI and combines all the results.
10. **Save to Google Docs:**
    *   The "Google Docs" node saves the generated insights into a Google Docs file.
11. **URL List Generation (Sub-Workflow):**
    *   The "Perplexity Research" node uses the Perplexity AI API to search for links related to a given niche.
    *   The "OpenAI" node converts the Perplexity Research output into a JSON format.
    *   The "Google Sheets" node append the information in a google sheet.
