## n8n Workflow: Create a Task in ClickUp

This workflow automates the creation of tasks in ClickUp whenever the workflow is manually triggered in n8n.

### Use cases:

*   **Quick Task Creation:**  Rapidly create tasks in your ClickUp workspace directly from the n8n interface, eliminating the need to manually navigate to ClickUp.
*   **On-Demand Task Generation:** Trigger the task creation process based on immediate needs or real-time situations that require action.
*   **Simple Task Management:** For users who want to create tasks directly within n8n without complex data transformations.

### How it works:

1.  **Manual Trigger:** The workflow starts when you manually click the "execute" button within the n8n editor.  This trigger initiates the workflow.
2.  **ClickUp Task Creation:** The "ClickUp" node then takes over.  It uses your ClickUp API credentials to connect to your ClickUp account and creates a task in a specified list.  Currently, the list, name, team, space and folder are not set, so the task creation will likely fail, or create a task with default settings. You'll need to configure these within the ClickUp node. The `additionalFields` parameter is also empty, meaning no additional properties are being set on the created task.
