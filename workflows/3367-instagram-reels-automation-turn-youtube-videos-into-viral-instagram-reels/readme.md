# Instagram Reels Automation

## Use cases:

- **Automated Content Posting:** Automatically post Instagram Reels based on predefined criteria, saving time and effort for social media managers.
- **Curated Content Pipeline:** Create a workflow to download, filter, and schedule the best reels from a source, ensuring a consistent stream of engaging content.
- **Hands-Free Content Distribution:** Automate the process of fetching reels, converting them to the correct format, and uploading them to Instagram, ideal for content creators.

## How it works:

1.  **Fill Information to Start:** A form trigger (`Fill information to Start`) initiates the workflow.
2.  **Prepare Reels:** An HTTP Request node (`Prepare Reels`) likely calls an API to prepare reels for processing.
3.  **Wait #1:** The workflow pauses (`Wait #1`).
4.  **Download Reels When Ready:** An HTTP Request node (`Download Reels When Ready`) is used to download reels.
5.  **Reels Ready?:** The workflow checks if Reels are ready via a conditional node (`Reels Ready?`). If yes, it proceeds; otherwise, it loops back to `Wait #1`.
6.  **Structure Reels:** The reels are processed and structured using the `Split Out` node (`Structure Reels`).
7.  **Filter the Best Reels to Upload:** A Code node (`Filter the Best Reels to Upload`) filters the reels based on custom logic.
8.  **Send Reels 1 at a time:** Reels are processed in batches using the `Split In Batches` node (`Send Reels 1 at a time`).
9.  **Download the Reels in the Right Format:** An HTTP Request node (`Download the Reels in the Right Format`) converts the reels to a format for Instagram.
10. **Post To Instagram:** The final HTTP Request node (`Post To Instagram`) uploads the formatted reel to Instagram.
11. **Wait #2:** The workflow pauses (`Wait #2`).
