# Effortless Email Management with AI

## Use cases:

- **Automated Email Response:** Automatically summarizes incoming emails, drafts replies based on company knowledge, and sends them after approval, saving time and improving response efficiency.
- **Improved Customer Support:** Uses AI to provide quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries by leveraging a knowledge base stored in a vector database, enhancing customer satisfaction.
- **Streamlined Internal Communication:** Summarizes long email threads, generates draft responses for internal communications, and ensures consistent messaging across the organization.

## How it works:

1.  **Email Trigger (IMAP):** The workflow starts when a new email is received via IMAP.
2.  **Markdown:** Converts the HTML content of the email into Markdown for better processing.
3.  **Email Summarization Chain:** Summarizes the email content using a Langchain summarization chain.
4.  **Write email:** Generates a draft reply to the email using an agent that leverages both the email summary and a vector database containing company knowledge.
5.  **Edit Fields:** Extracts the email from the output of the LLM and stores it in a new field.
6.  **Text Classifier:** Uses a text classifier to determine whether the user has approved or declined the email.
7.  **Email Reviewer:** If the email has been declined, the Email Reviewer will rewrite the email, taking inspiration from the human feedback.
8.  **Send Email:** Sends the final email based on the approval from the text classifier.
9.  **Qdrant Vector Store:** Inserts data to the Qdrant Vector Store using Google Drive documents.
