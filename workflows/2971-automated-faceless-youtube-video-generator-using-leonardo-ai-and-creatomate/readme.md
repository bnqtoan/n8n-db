# GenerateFacelessYoutubeVideo

## Use cases:

1.  **Automated Content Creation for YouTube:** This workflow can be used to automatically generate video content for YouTube channels on a recurring schedule, reducing the manual effort required for video creation.
2.  **Generating Visuals for AI-Driven Storytelling:** By combining an AI agent with image generation, the workflow can create videos based on AI-generated stories or scripts, perfect for channels focused on creative content.
3.  **Creating "Did you know?" or Facts Channels** The workflow can generate images based on a prompt. Then, it generates a video with that image, which can be used to create "did you know?" or facts videos for Youtube.

## How it works:

This workflow automates the process of creating faceless YouTube videos by combining AI-generated content and images. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Schedule Trigger:** The workflow is initiated by a "Schedule Trigger" node, allowing for automated video creation at specified intervals.
2.  **AI Content Generation:** An "AI Agent" node, potentially using a Large Language Model (LLM) and structured output parser, generates video scripts or content. The "OpenAI Chat Model" and "Structured Output Parser" nodes define the specific AI model used and the desired output format, respectively.
3.  **Image Generation with LeonardoAI:** Based on the AI-generated script, the workflow generates images using the LeonardoAI service through multiple "Generate Image - LeonadoAI" nodes (1-6). Each image generation request is followed by a "Wait" node, allowing time for the image to be generated, and then a "Get Image URL - LeonadoAI" node to retrieve the generated image's URL.
4.  **Image URL Processing:** The URLs of all images are set to a specific field, using "Edit Fields" nodes.
5.  **Merge Images:** All of the image URLs get merged together into one single item.
6.  **Video Generation:** The workflow sends an HTTP request to a service to generate a video using the provided images and potentially the generated script. This is handled by the "Cre - Generate Video1" node.
7.  **Video Retrieval:** After generating the video, the workflow waits for it to be ready and retrieves it using the "Cre - Get Video" node, after waiting for "Wait6" to make sure it exists.
8.  **YouTube Upload:** The video is then uploaded to YouTube using the "YouTube" node.
9.  **Telegram Notification:** Finally, a "Telegram" node sends a notification, likely containing the link to the newly uploaded video.

## Services:
