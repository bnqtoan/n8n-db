# SecurityScorecard Workflow

## Use cases:

*   **Automated Security Assessment:** Automatically generate and download security scorecards for specific domains (e.g., a company's website) on a scheduled basis or on-demand.
*   **Third-Party Risk Management:** Integrate security scorecard data into a risk management dashboard to monitor the security posture of vendors and partners.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Set up a workflow to periodically generate security scorecards and trigger alerts or actions based on changes in the security score.

## How it works:

This workflow automates the process of generating and downloading security scorecards using the SecurityScorecard API.

1.  **Manual Trigger:** The workflow is initiated manually by clicking the "execute" button in n8n.
2.  **Generate Full Scorecard:** The `SecurityScorecard` node generates a full security scorecard in JSON format for the specified domain (`n8n.io`).
3.  **Retrieve Report Download Link:** The `SecurityScorecard1` node retrieves the download URL for the generated scorecard.
4.  **Download Report:** The `SecurityScorecard2` node downloads the security scorecard using the URL obtained from the previous step.
