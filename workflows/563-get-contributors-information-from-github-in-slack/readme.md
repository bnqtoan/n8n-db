# Slack-GitHub User Info

## Use cases:

- **Quickly retrieve and share GitHub user information:**  A team member can use a Slack command to request details about a GitHub user (e.g., potential contributor, team member), and the workflow will automatically fetch and post the user's name, email(s), company, location, and avatar in a specified Slack channel.
- **Lead Enrichment:** Sales or recruiting teams can automatically grab contact information from github and consolidate for future outreach.
- **Streamline Collaboration:**  Facilitate easier collaboration by providing quick access to a user's contact information.  For example, during code reviews, reviewers can quickly access the author's email to discuss specific issues.

## How it works:

1.  **Webhook:**  The workflow is triggered by a POST request to a specific webhook URL. The request is expected to contain the GitHub username in the `body.text` field and the Slack channel ID in the `body.channel_id` field.
2.  **GraphQL:**  The GitHub GraphQL API is queried using the username obtained from the webhook. The query retrieves the user's name, company, location, avatar URL, public email, and a list of pull requests with their associated commits.  A personal access token is required for authentication.
3.  **Function:** This node extracts the emails of the user, filters emails that are generated by GitHub and removes any duplicates that might be present.
4.  **Slack:** The collected information (name, email(s), company, location, and avatar) is formatted and posted as a message to the specified Slack channel using the Slack API. The username from the initial webhook request is used as a title.
