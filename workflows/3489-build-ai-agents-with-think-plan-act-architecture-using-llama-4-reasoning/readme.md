# AI think mode

## Use cases:

- **Complex Task Decomposition:** This workflow can be used to break down a complex task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. The "Think" and "Act" nodes can iteratively plan and execute these sub-tasks.
- **Decision-Making Automation:** By connecting to external data sources (e.g., weather APIs, databases), the workflow can gather information, analyze it using the AI agents, and make decisions based on predefined criteria.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot Enhancement:** Integrating this workflow into a chatbot can enable it to handle more complex queries by using the AI agents to reason and generate more relevant and comprehensive responses.

## How it works:

The workflow simulates an AI "thinking" process to accomplish tasks. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow is initiated either by the `start-thinking` webhook or the `get-weather` webhook.
2.  **Configuration:** Code nodes (`Config`, `Config1`) likely prepare the input data or configuration for the AI agents.
3.  **Thinking Stage:** `OpenRouter Chat Model4` and `OpenRouter Chat Model5` and `OpenRouter Chat Model6` and `OpenRouter Chat Model7` nodes use the OpenRouter Chat Model to do the heavy lifting of thinking. The `Thinking output parser` and `Thinking output parser1` extract structured output from the AI model response.
4.  **Planning & Acting:** The "Think" and "Think1" nodes are Langchain Agents that likely plan the next steps and delegate actions.
5.  **Action Execution:** The "Act" and "Act1" nodes, also Langchain Agents, execute the planned actions. This might involve making API calls or manipulating data. The `Task Output Parser` extract structured output from the AI model response.
6. **OpenRouter Chat Model1, OpenRouter Chat Model2, OpenRouter Chat Model3**: These models generate structured output from the models.
7.  **Output:** The "No Operation, do nothing" node acts as a placeholder, indicating where the final output or result should be connected to within a larger workflow. And `Code` node does another operation.

## Services:

-   **OpenRouter API:** Used via the Langchain nodes (`@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenRouter`) for AI model access.
-   **Webhooks:** Used to trigger the workflow (`start-thinking` and `get-weather`).
