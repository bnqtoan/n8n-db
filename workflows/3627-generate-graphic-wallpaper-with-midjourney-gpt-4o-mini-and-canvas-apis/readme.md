# Generate Graphic Wallpaper with Midjourney, GPT-4o-mini and Canvas APIs

## Use cases:

- **Automated Social Media Content Creation:** Generate visually appealing wallpapers with trending topics or quotes for social media platforms. This is useful for content creators, marketers, and social media managers looking to automate their content pipeline.
- **Personalized Wallpaper Generation:** Allow users to input their personal theme, feeling, and scenario to generate unique and emotionally resonant wallpapers for their devices.
- **Artistic Exploration and Prototyping:** Quickly prototype and generate a series of graphic wallpapers with different styles and themes using the combined power of LLMs, AI art generators, and design APIs.

## How it works:

This workflow automates the generation of graphic wallpapers using a combination of services:

1.  **Manual Trigger:** The workflow starts when triggered manually by clicking "Test workflow".
2.  **Basic Parameters:** Sets up the basic parameters for the whole workflow, including API keys, theme, scenario, style preferences, example sentences and an image prompt.
3.  **GPT-4o-mini API:** Takes the defined `theme`, `scenario`, `style` and `example` and uses the GPT-4o-mini model (via the PiAPI) to generate a creative and inspiring text prompt.
4.  **Get Prompt:** Combines the `image_prompt` from the basic parameters with the text generated by GPT-4o-mini.
5.  **Midjourney Generator:** Sends the combined prompt to Midjourney (via PiAPI) to generate an image based on the prompt.
6.  **Wait for Midjourney Generation:** Pauses the workflow until the Midjourney task is completed.
7.  **Get Midjourney Task:** Retrieves the result of the Midjourney task.
8.  **Determine Whether the Image URL was Fetched:** Checks whether the task has `completed` or `failed`. If failed, it loops back to the "Wait for Midjourney Generation" node.
9.  **Check Image Generation Status:** Checks the status of the Midjourney image generation. If `completed` the flow will continue, otherwise the flow stops.
10. **Get Image URL:** Retrieves the generated `temporary_image_urls` and `image_url`.
11. **Design in Canvas:** Takes the generated image URL and the GPT-4o-mini text prompt and uses the Canvas API to create a visually appealing wallpaper design, applying the prompt as text over the image.

## Services:

*   **PiAPI:** Used for accessing both the GPT-4o-mini and Midjourney APIs.
*   **Midjourney:** An AI art generation tool used to create images based on prompts.
*   **GPT-4o-mini:** A language model used to generate creative text.
*   **Canvas API (switchboard.ai):** A design API used to create the final wallpaper image.
