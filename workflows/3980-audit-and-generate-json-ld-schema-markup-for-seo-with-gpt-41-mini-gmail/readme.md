# My Workflow

## Use cases:

- **Generate Schema Markup from Form Submissions:** Automatically create structured data markup (Schema.org) based on user input from a form. This markup can then be used to enhance SEO and improve the visibility of content in search engine results.
- **Automated SEO Enhancement:** Extract specific data points from a form submission and use them to generate schema markup that is relevant to the content being submitted. This helps search engines better understand the context of the content.

## How it works:

1.  **On form submission:** The workflow starts when a user submits a form.
2.  **Schema Markup Agent:** The data from the form submission is fed into a Langchain Agent which is designed to generate schema markup. This agent utilizes various tools and a language model.
3.  **OpenRouter (Language Model):** The Langchain Agent uses OpenRouter as its primary language model to understand the form data and generate appropriate schema markup.
4.  **Code and HTTP Request:** The Agent has access to code execution and HTTP Request tool.
5.  **Auto-fixing Output Parser:** A Langchain Auto-fixing Output Parser refines the initial output into a structured format.
6. **Structured Output:** Uses Langchain Structured Output to ensure that output can be structured
7.  **OpenRouter1 (Language Model):** The refined result uses OpenRouter as a language model
8.  **Send to your email:** Finally, the generated schema markup is sent to a specified email address.

## Services:

-   **OpenRouter:** A service providing access to various language models.
-   **Gmail:** Used to send the generated schema markup to a specified email address.
