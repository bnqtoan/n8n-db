# Daily meetings summarization with Gemini AI

## Use cases:

- **Daily Briefing:** Automatically send a summary of the day's meetings to a Slack channel every morning, providing team members with a quick overview of their schedule.
- **Meeting Prep:** Use the summary to prepare for upcoming meetings, ensuring you're up-to-date on the key topics and attendees.
- **Time Management:** Help users quickly understand how their time is allocated across meetings and identify potential scheduling conflicts.

## How it works:

1.  **Schedule Trigger:** The workflow is triggered daily at 9 AM using the "Schedule Trigger" node.
2.  **Calendar AI Agent:** The AI Agent uses the provided date range from now and the tools to call the correct nodes.
3.  **Google Calendar - Get Events:** Based on the values returned from "Calendar AI Agent" this node retrieve the meeting data for the current day from a specified Google Calendar. The `timeMin` and `timeMax` parameters are dynamically set to the start and end of the current day.
4.  **Google Gemini Chat Model:** Based on the values returned from "Calendar AI Agent" this Gemini model generates a summary of the meetings from the AI model.
5.  **Send response back to slack channel:** Post the meetings summary generated by the AI to a specific Slack channel. The `text` parameter uses an expression to format the AI output and remove Markdown before sending.
