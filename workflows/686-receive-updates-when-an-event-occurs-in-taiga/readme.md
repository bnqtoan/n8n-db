# Receive updates when an event occurs in Taiga

## Use cases:

*   **Real-time Notifications:** Get instant updates in a communication channel (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) whenever there's a new event in a Taiga project, ensuring the team stays informed about project activities.
*   **Automated Reporting:** Trigger automated reports or dashboard updates when specific events occur in Taiga, providing stakeholders with up-to-date project status.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered by the "Taiga Trigger" node. This node listens for events within a specified Taiga project.  When an event occurs in the project, the workflow is initiated. The workflow currently consists of only a trigger, meaning further nodes need to be added to define actions to perform upon event occurrence. For instance, adding a "HTTP Request" node connected to the "Taiga Trigger" to fetch additional information, or a "Slack" node to send notification.
