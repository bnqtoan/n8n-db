## Use cases:

- **Customer Support Automation:**  Automate frequently asked questions (FAQs) handling for customers via WhatsApp, providing instant answers and reducing the workload on human support agents.
- **Lead Qualification and Service Request:**  Guide potential customers through a series of questions to understand their needs and collect necessary information before connecting them with a sales representative or offering consultation.
- **Product Information and Sales Assistance:** Offer an automated conversational flow that provides product information, answers pre-sales questions, and guides users towards making a purchase decision.

## How it works:

1.  The workflow starts with a **WhatsApp Trigger** node, which listens for incoming messages on a designated WhatsApp number.
2.  The message is then processed by the **Initialization** node, likely setting up initial variables or context for the conversation.
3.  The **Get Bot Status** node queries a PostgreSQL database to retrieve the current status of the bot for that particular user.
4.  A **Define Flow** node (Switch) determines which path to take based on the bot's status.  It might direct new users to a welcome message (**Starts**), route existing users to a command processing flow (**Commands**), or handle other specific scenarios.
5.  The **Commands** node uses a Switch node to route the message to the correct flow based on the message contents.
6.  If the user requests FAQs, the **Get FAQs** node retrieves relevant questions and answers from a PostgreSQL database.  The results are processed and sent back to the user via a **WhatsApp** node.
7.  If a consultation is requested the user is connected to the manager using the **Request Manager** node, other nodes are used to update the bot status.
