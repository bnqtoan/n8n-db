# My Workflow

## Use cases:
- Encrypting sensitive data before storing it in a database or sending it via email.
- Generating unique identifiers or tokens for user authentication.
- Obfuscating data for testing purposes.

## How it works:
1.  The workflow is triggered manually using the "On clicking 'execute'" node.
2.  The "Crypto" node then encrypts the string "n8n rocks!". The encrypted output is then available for use in subsequent nodes (although there are none in this workflow).

## Services:
- None. This workflow only utilizes n8n's built-in Crypto node for encryption.

## Hashtags:
#n8n #encryption #security #automation #crypto
