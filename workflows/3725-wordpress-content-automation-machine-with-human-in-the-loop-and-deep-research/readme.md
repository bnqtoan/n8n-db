# Main Flow - Human-in-the-Loop Content Automation Pro - with Deep Research

## Use Cases:

- **Automated Blog Post Generation:** This workflow can automate the creation of blog posts from topic ideation and research to content generation, image creation, and publishing to WordPress.
- **Content Repurposing:** The workflow can be adapted to repurpose existing content, such as articles or reports, into new formats like blog posts with featured images and chapter-specific visuals.
- **SEO Content Creation:** The workflow can be used to create SEO-optimized content by incorporating internal links, researching relevant topics, and generating engaging content that drives traffic.

## How it works:

This workflow automates content creation with human-in-the-loop elements, using Airtable as a database and OpenAI/Langchain for content generation. It starts with triggers based on Airtable records for new topics or content needing updates. The workflow proceeds as follows:

1.  **Topic/Content Selection:** It begins with an Airtable trigger that monitors for new topics or selected content in Airtable.
2.  **Topic Research & Confirmation:** The workflow uses an "Initial Research" block, potentially leveraging Langchain agents and OpenAI Chat Models to gather information related to the topic. A human can confirm the topic.
3.  **Content Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI/Langchain to generate content, dividing it into chapters and generating images. The workflow uses Airtable to store and manage this content.
4.  **Internal Linking:** Gathers internal links from a sitemap, aggregates them, and uses them in the content.
5.  **Featured Image Creation:** Generates a featured image using OpenAI, resizes it, and uploads it to Google Drive.
6.  **Chapter Image Creation:** Generates chapter-specific images and uploads them.
7.  **Article Assembly:** Combines the content, formats it in Markdown and HTML.
8.  **WordPress Posting:** Finally, the workflow uploads the content to WordPress, sets the featured image, and updates the status in Airtable.

Throughout the process, "Wait" nodes with webhooks are utilized to pause execution and allow for human intervention, such as content review or approval, before proceeding to the next step. Multiple loops handle content and chapter processing, with deletion of temporary records and updating of Airtable statuses at various stages.
