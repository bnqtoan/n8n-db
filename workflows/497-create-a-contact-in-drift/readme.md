## n8n Workflow: Create a Contact in Drift

### Use cases:

*   **New Lead Capture:** Automatically create a new contact in Drift whenever a lead interacts with your n8n workflow (e.g., form submission, webhook trigger).
*   **Manual Contact Creation:** Quickly add a contact to Drift directly from n8n for immediate follow-up.

### How it works:

This workflow creates a new contact in Drift. It starts with a "Manual Trigger" node, which, when executed, triggers the workflow. The subsequent "Drift" node takes the provided email address and any additional information, then creates a new contact within your Drift account.  The email and additional fields can be populated with data from previous nodes for a fully automated flow.
