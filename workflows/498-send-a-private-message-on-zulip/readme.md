## n8n Workflow: Send a Private Message on Zulip

This workflow automates the process of sending a private message on Zulip.

**Use cases:**

*   **Personal Reminders:** Send yourself reminders directly to your Zulip account.
*   **Quick Notifications:** Trigger a Zulip message to alert a colleague when a specific event occurs (e.g., a file is uploaded, a task is completed, requires additional nodes not present in this workflow).

**How it works:**

1.  The workflow starts with a "Manual Trigger" node, which requires you to manually execute the workflow to initiate the message sending.
2.  The "Zulip" node then takes the data and sends a private message to the specified recipient on Zulip. Note: The recipient needs to be configured in the Zulip node's settings (currently missing from the provided JSON).

**Services:**

*   Zulip
