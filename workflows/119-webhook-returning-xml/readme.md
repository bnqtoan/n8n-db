## n8n Workflow: XML Conversion and Webhook Response

This workflow receives data via a webhook, transforms it into XML format, and sends the XML response back to the webhook caller.

### Use cases:

*   **API Data Transformation:**  Receive data from one API (via webhook), convert it to XML, and make it available for systems expecting XML data.
*   **Simple Data Formatting:** Easily format data received from any source (e.g., form submissions) into XML for storage or processing.
*   **Legacy System Integration:** Act as a bridge between modern systems sending JSON and older systems that require XML data.

### How it works:

1.  **Webhook (Webhook):** The workflow starts when it receives a POST request at the specified webhook path ("test").
2.  **Set (Set):** This node defines a simple JSON data structure. It creates a JSON object with a number field set to 1 and a string field set to "my text". This is used as the data to be transformed.
3.  **XML (XML):** This node converts the JSON data into XML format. The `mode` parameter is set to `jsonToxml`, specifying the direction of conversion.
4.  **Respond to Webhook (Respond to Webhook):**  This node sends the XML data back as the response to the incoming webhook request.  It sets the `content-type` header to `application/xml` to ensure the receiver interprets the data correctly. The `responseBody` is set to the XML data generated by the XML node.

### Services:

*   None (This workflow does not directly interact with external services beyond n8n itself.)
