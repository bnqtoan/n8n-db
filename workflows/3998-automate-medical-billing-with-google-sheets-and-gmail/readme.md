# Medical Billing Automation Template

## Use cases:

-   **Automated Invoice Generation:** Automatically generate and send invoices to patients upon form submission, reducing manual effort and improving billing accuracy.
-   **Error Handling and Notifications:** Implement error checks to identify potential issues in submitted data, and automatically notify administrators for timely resolution.
-   **Data Logging and Tracking:** Log invoice data to Google Sheets for record-keeping, analysis, and reporting purposes.

## How it works:

1.  **Form Submission:** The workflow is triggered when a new form is submitted ("On form submission" node).
2.  **Data Structuring:** The submitted data is structured into a specific format ("Data Structure1" node).
3.  **Date Formatting:** The date is formatted to the desired style ("Format Date" node).
4.  **Price Calculation:** Prices are calculated based on the submitted data ("Calculate prices" node).
5.  **Error Checking:** The workflow checks for errors in the data ("Error Check1" node).
6.  **Error Handling:** If errors are found, an error message is generated ("Generate Error Message1" node) and an admin notification is sent ("Admin Notification1" node).
7.  **Invoice Sending:** If no errors are found, an invoice email is sent to the patient ("Send Patient Invoice Email" node).
8.  **Data Logging:** Invoice data is logged to a Google Sheet ("Log Invoice to Googlesheets" node).
