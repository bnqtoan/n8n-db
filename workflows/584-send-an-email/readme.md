# Send Email Demo

## Use cases:

- Send automated email notifications upon manual trigger, such as for system alerts or personalized messages.
- Quickly send test emails during development or debugging to verify email configurations and content.

## How it works:

This workflow is triggered manually. When the "On clicking 'execute'" node is executed, it initiates the workflow.  The "Send Email" node then sends an email to the specified recipient with the configured subject and body. The workflow requires valid SMTP credentials to send emails.

## Services:

- SMTP Server (Configured via credentials)
