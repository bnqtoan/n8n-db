## n8n Workflow: Send Email via Mailjet

This workflow automates the process of sending an email using the Mailjet service.

**Use cases:**

*   **Manual email sending:** Quickly send ad-hoc emails for testing or individual communication without needing a full email client.
*   **Simple notification system:** Integrate this workflow into a larger process to send immediate email notifications when certain events occur.

**How it works:**

1.  The workflow is triggered manually by clicking the "Execute" button in n8n.
2.  The "Mailjet" node then takes the provided email details (recipient, sender, subject, and body) and sends the email using your Mailjet account credentials.

**Services:**

*   Mailjet
