# My Workflow

## Use Cases:
- **Automated Email Campaigns:** Launch and manage email marketing campaigns by fetching recipient data from a Google Sheet, validating emails, and sending personalized emails.
- **Lead Nurturing:**  Automatically nurture leads by sending a series of personalized emails based on their data stored in a Google Sheet.
- **Personalized Communication at Scale:**  Create and send personalized email communications to a large number of recipients using data from a spreadsheet and AI-powered content generation.

## How it Works:
1.  **Start Campaign Trigger:** The workflow begins with a manual trigger, allowing you to initiate the campaign.
2.  **Fetch Recipient Data:**  The workflow retrieves recipient data from a Google Sheet using the "Fetch Recipient Data" node.
3.  **Validate Email Addresses:** An "If" node validates the email addresses.
4.  **Process Recipients:**  The "Process Recipients" node splits the recipient data into batches for processing.
5.  **Create Personalized Email:** For each recipient, the "Create Personalized Email" node generates a personalized email body using the Langchain Open AI node based on the fetched data.
6.  **Send Email:** The "Send Email" node sends the personalized email to the recipient.
7.  **Set Status to "Sent":** The "Set Status to 'Sent'" node updates a status in the workflow.
8.  **Update Recipient Status:**  The "Update Recipient Status" node updates the recipient's status in the Google Sheet.
9.  **Generate Random Delay:** To avoid triggering spam filters, a random delay is introduced before processing the next batch using the "Generate Random Delay" node.
10. **Pause Between Emails:**  A "Wait" node pauses the workflow for a random time.
11. The workflow loops back to the "Process Recipients" node to continue processing the next batch of recipients until all recipients have been processed.
