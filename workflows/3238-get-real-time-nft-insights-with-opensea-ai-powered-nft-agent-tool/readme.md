# OpenSea NFT Agent Tool

## Use Cases
1. **NFT Portfolio Tracking**: Automatically retrieve and organize NFTs owned by a specific wallet address across multiple blockchains for personal asset tracking or investment analysis.
2. **Market Research**: Analyze NFT collection metrics (market cap, floor price, sales trends) to identify valuable opportunities or trending projects.
3. **Metadata Verification**: Validate NFT ownership, traits, and contract details during transactions or marketplace listings to prevent fraud.

## How It Works
This AI-powered workflow uses GPT-4 to process natural language queries about NFTs, then executes structured API calls to OpenSea. Key steps: 

1. **Input Handling**: Receives user questions via message input (e.g., "Show NFTs owned by 0x123...").
2. **AI Analysis**: GPT-4 interprets the request and selects appropriate OpenSea API endpoints.
3. **Data Retrieval**: Executes one of 12 specialized API calls including:
   - Account/profile lookups
   - Collection/contract metadata
   - NFT trait analysis
   - Bulk NFT listings with filters
4. **Context Management**: Maintains conversation history via memory buffer for multi-step queries.
5. **Result Formatting**: Returns structured API responses with error code validation.
