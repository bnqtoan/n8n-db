# MCP Supabase

## Use cases:

- **AI-Powered Customer Support:** Allow an AI agent to answer customer queries by searching, creating, updating, and deleting information in a Supabase database. For example, customers can ask to create a new support ticket or update the status of an existing one via a chat interface.
- **Automated Data Management with Chat Interface:** Enable users to manage data stored in Supabase through a conversational AI. Users can ask the AI to retrieve specific information, add new entries, or modify existing data, all via a chat interface, streamlining data management processes.
- **Real-time Inventory Management:** Use the workflow to manage a product inventory. The AI agent can respond to requests to update stock levels, search for product details, or create new product entries, all based on real-time data from Supabase.

## How it works:

This workflow connects a chat interface to a Supabase database via an AI agent, allowing users to interact with the database through natural language.

1.  **When chat message received:** The workflow starts when a user sends a message through the chat interface (`@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger`).
2.  **AI Agent:** The message is then sent to an AI agent (`@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent`), which determines the user's intent and the necessary actions to take. The AI Agent is connected to:
    *   **Model Chat:** Uses a language model (likely OpenAI's, `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi`) to process the message and generate a response.
    *   **Simple Memory:** Employs a memory buffer window (`@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow`) to maintain context and improve the AI's understanding of the conversation.
    *   **MCP Supabase:** A tool (`@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcpClientTool`) that prepares the data to interact with Supabase.
3.  **MCP Server Supabase**: A trigger (`@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcpTrigger`) that activates one of the Supabase actions based on the AI agentâ€™s decision:
    *   **Create Row:** Creates a new row in a Supabase table (`n8n-nodes-base.supabaseTool`).
    *   **Delete Row:** Deletes an existing row from a Supabase table (`n8n-nodes-base.supabaseTool`).
    *   **Search Single Line:** Searches for a specific row in a Supabase table (`n8n-nodes-base.supabaseTool`).
    *   **Search All Lines:** Searches for all rows in a Supabase table (`n8n-nodes-base.supabaseTool`).
    *   **Update Line:** Updates an existing row in a Supabase table (`n8n-nodes-base.supabaseTool`).
