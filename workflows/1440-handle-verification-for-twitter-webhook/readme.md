# Twitter CRC Check

## Use cases:

*   **Automated Twitter Bot Verification:** Automatically respond to Twitter's Challenge Response Check (CRC) to verify a webhook subscription for a Twitter bot or application.
*   **Real-time Twitter Event Handling:** Securely validate and process real-time events from Twitter webhooks, ensuring data integrity and authenticity.

## How it works:

1.  The workflow starts with a **Webhook** node that listens for incoming HTTP requests from Twitter.  It's triggered by the Twitter CRC request sent to the specified path.
2.  The **Crypto** node receives the `crc_token` from the webhook's query parameters. It then generates an HMAC SHA256 hash using the `crc_token` and a secret API key. The resulting hash is encoded in Base64.
3.  The **Set** node takes the Base64-encoded SHA256 hash generated by the Crypto node and formats it into a JSON structure with the key "response\_token" prefixed with "sha256=". This formatted token is what Twitter expects as a response for the CRC check. The node is configured to only keep the `response_token` in the output.

## Services:

*   Twitter API (via Webhook)
