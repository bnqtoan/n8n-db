# Automate Your Customer Service With WhatsApp Business Cloud & Asana

## Use cases:

- **Automated Customer Support Ticket Creation:** When a customer submits a form with a question or issue, automatically create a support ticket in Asana to ensure that the issue is tracked and addressed.
- **Instant Confirmation via WhatsApp:** Immediately send a confirmation message to the customer via WhatsApp upon form submission, acknowledging their request and setting expectations for a response.
- **Streamlined Data Capture and Task Management:** Capture customer inquiries through a simple form and seamlessly transfer the data to a task management system, improving team efficiency and response times.

## How it works:

1.  **n8n Form Trigger:** The workflow starts when a customer submits the "Contact Us!" form. The form captures the customer's name, phone number, and problem description.
2.  **WhatsApp Business Cloud:** Upon form submission, a WhatsApp message is sent to the customer. This message confirms that the form has been received and that the support team will be in contact soon. The message includes the customer's name for personalization.  *Note:  Requires you to replace YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER with your actual WhatsApp Business Cloud phone number.*
3.  **Asana:** Simultaneously, a new task is created in Asana to manage the support request. The task's name includes the submission timestamp, and the customer's problem description is added as notes to the task. *Note: Requires you to replace YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID with your actual Asana workspace ID.*
