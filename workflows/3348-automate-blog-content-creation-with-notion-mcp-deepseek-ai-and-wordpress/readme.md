# DeepSeek v3.1

## Use cases:

- **Automated Content Publishing:** Automatically create and publish SEO-optimized blog posts to WordPress whenever a new item is added or updated in a specified Notion database. This is useful for content creators, marketers, or businesses that want to streamline their content creation and publishing process.
- **Real-time Notification System:** Send email notifications when a blog post is published, providing the title and URL of the new content. This helps keep stakeholders informed and drives traffic to the new article.
- **Streamlined Content Management:** Keep your Notion database updated with key information about published articles, such as title, content, URL, and status. This ensures that your content management system stays synchronized with your published content.

## How it works:

1. **Watch for Notion Updates:** The workflow starts by monitoring a specific Notion database for new or updated pages using the "Watch Notion Updates" node.
2. **Set Workflow Variables:** The "Edit Workflow Variables" node allows you to set your email address, Notion database ID, and Notion item ID.
3. **AI Task Planner:** The "AI Task Planner" node uses the DeepSeek Chat Model and the Langchain agent to generate an SEO-optimized blog post based on keywords found in the Notion update. The AI also crafts an email and prepares the content for WordPress publication. This node orchestrates the entire content creation and notification process.
4. **Retrieve List of Notion Tools:** Use a Multipurpose Client Protocol(MCP) client to retrieve the available tools to interact with Notion.
5. **DeepSeek Chat Model:** The DeepSeek Chat Model node handles the heavy lifting of language processing and output generation, providing the Langchain agent with the ability to create content, draft emails, and structure data for WordPress.
6. **Publish Blog Post:** The "Publish Blog Post" node publishes the generated content to a WordPress blog, using the article title and content.
7. **Send Email:** The "Send Email" node sends an email notification with the article's title and URL to the specified email address.
8. **Update Notion Database:** Use a Multipurpose Client Protocol(MCP) client to update the entry to Notion database with the generated content, URL and status.
