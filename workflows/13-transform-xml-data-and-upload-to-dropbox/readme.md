# n8n Workflow: XML Transformation and Dropbox Upload

This workflow automates the process of fetching XML data from a URL, transforming it by modifying the title, converting it back to XML format, and then uploading the resulting XML file to a Dropbox account.

## Use cases:

*   **Automated Content Updates:** Regularly update XML content on a Dropbox account based on data fetched from an external source. This could be used for updating configuration files or data feeds.
*   **Dynamic Data Transformation:** Modify specific elements within an XML structure (like the title in this example) before storing the updated version in Dropbox. This is helpful for adapting data to specific application requirements.
*   **Backup and Versioning:** Create automated backups of XML data, with modifications, stored in Dropbox.

## How it works:

1.  **Get XML Data:** The workflow starts with an "HTTP Request" node that fetches XML data from the specified URL (`https://httpbin.org/xml`). The response is received as a string.
2.  **To JSON:** The "To JSON" node converts the XML string into a JSON object. This makes it easier to manipulate the data.
3.  **Change title:** The "Change title" node modifies the `slideshow.title` field within the JSON data, replacing it with "New Title Name".
4.  **To XML:** The "To XML" node converts the modified JSON data back into an XML string.
5.  **Dropbox:** Finally, the "Dropbox" node uploads the generated XML string to a specified path (`/my-xml-file.xml`) in your Dropbox account.  **Note:** You need to configure the Dropbox API credentials for this node to work.

## Services:

*   **HTTP Request** (using `https://httpbin.org/xml`)
*   **Dropbox**
